title: Logging in your User
---

Use the `login` function in the Web3Auth Instance to log in user. Just create a button that triggers
the `login` for the user of the login method of their choice.

After a successful user login, Web3Auth will redirect back to your app, with a payload stored in the
state of the Web3Auth Instance.
