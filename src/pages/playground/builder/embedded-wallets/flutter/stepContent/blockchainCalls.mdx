### Making Blockchain Calls

While using the Web3Auth Flutter SDK, you get the private key within the user scope. This private key can interact with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to make any blockchain calls, like getting user's `account`, fetch `balance`, `sign transaction`, `send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc.
