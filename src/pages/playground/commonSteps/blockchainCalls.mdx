Web3Auth is chain agnostic. This means that you can use it with any blockchain with the provider
exposed by Web3Auth. For EVM and Solana Blockchains Web3Auth exposes special providers for native
integrations.

This example demonstrates the connection for an EVM Chain with Web3Auth. You can choose the library
of your choice and configure it according the steps given in the respective RPC Files.
