### Configure for Wallet Aggregator Only

To use Web3Auth as a wallet aggregator only (without social logins), disable social connections in your Web3Auth Dashboard project settings.

Navigate to **Authentication > Social Connections** and turn off all social login providers to use Web3Auth purely as a wallet aggregator.
