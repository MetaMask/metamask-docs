### Set up the Wagmi provider

Since this example uses `wagmi`, wrap your app with the `WagmiProvider` from
`@web3auth/modal/react/wagmi`.

```tsx
import { WagmiProvider } from '@web3auth/modal/react/wagmi'
```

This example uses the standard Wagmi setup. You don't need to create a Wagmi config; the Web3Auth
config is used directly. See the [Wagmi docs](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started) for more
information.
