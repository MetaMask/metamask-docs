### Making Blockchain Calls

Since Wagmi is configured in this application, you can directly use the wagmi hooks to make blockchain calls. We have demonstrated some commonly used hooks like `useBalance`, `useAccount`, `useSignMessage`, `useSendTransaction` and `useSwitchChain`.

:::info

You can refer to the [**wagmi docs**](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks) for more information on the hooks.
