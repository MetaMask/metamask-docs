### Make blockchain calls

Because Wagmi is configured in this application, you can use Wagmi hooks to make
blockchain calls. This example demonstrates common hooks:
`useBalance`, `useAccount`, `useSignMessage`, `useSendTransaction`, and `useSwitchChain`.

See the [Wagmi documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks) for more information on the
hooks.

:::tip Connect any blockchain

Refer to the [blockchain documentation](/embedded-wallets/connect-blockchain)
to learn more about making calls on any supported blockchain.
