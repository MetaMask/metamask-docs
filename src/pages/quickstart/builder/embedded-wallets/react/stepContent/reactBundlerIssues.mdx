### Troubleshooting

When using web3 libraries in React, you may encounter build errors. This happens because some packages
(for example, `eccrypto`) depend on Node.js modules that aren't available in the browser build
environment.

To resolve these errors, see the [Vite issues](/embedded-wallets/troubleshooting/vite-issues/) page.
