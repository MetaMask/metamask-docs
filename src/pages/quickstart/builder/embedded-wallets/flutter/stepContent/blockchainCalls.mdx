### Make blockchain calls

After the user signs in, the SDK provides a user-scoped private key.

Use the private key to interact with chains such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to make
blockchain calls, like fetching a user's account balance, signing or sending
transactions, and reading or writing to smart contracts.

:::info Connect any blockchain

Refer to the [blockchain documentation](/embedded-wallets/connect-blockchain/) to learn more about
making calls on any supported blockchain.
