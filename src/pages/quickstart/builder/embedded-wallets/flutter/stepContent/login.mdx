### Sign in your user

Use the `Web3Auth` instance [`login`](/embedded-wallets/sdk/flutter/usage#logging-in-a-user)
function to sign in the user. You can create a button that triggers the `login` function for the
sign in method of their choice.

After a successful sign-in, the SDK stores the session state internally, and the user is redirected
back to your app.
