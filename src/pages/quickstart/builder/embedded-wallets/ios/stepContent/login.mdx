### Sign in the user

Use the [`login`](/embedded-wallets/sdk/ios/usage/login) function of the
`web3Auth` instance to sign in the user. You can trigger it from a button or other user action.

After a successful user sign-in, Web3Auth returns the user to your app, with a payload stored in the
state of the `web3Auth` instance.
