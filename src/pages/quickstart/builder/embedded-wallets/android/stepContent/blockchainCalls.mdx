### Make blockchain calls

After the user signs in, the SDK provides a user-scoped private key and session ID.

Use the private key to interact with chains such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to make
blockchain calls, like fetching a user's account balance, signing or sending
transactions, and reading or writing to smart contracts.

This quickstart includes a basic EVM-based example for your reference.
