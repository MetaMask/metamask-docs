### Make blockchain calls

After the user signs in, the SDK provides a user-scoped private key and session ID.

Use the private key to interact with chains such as [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to make
blockchain calls, like fetching a user's account balance, sign or send
transactions, read and write to smart contracts, on so on.

We added a basic EVM chain based example here for your reference.
