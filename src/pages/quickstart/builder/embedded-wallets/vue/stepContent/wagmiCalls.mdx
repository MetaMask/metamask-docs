### Making Blockchain Calls

Since Wagmi is configured in this application, you can directly use the wagmi composables to make blockchain calls. We have demonstrated some commonly used composables like `useBalance`, `useAccount`, `useSignMessage`, `useSendTransaction` and `useSwitchChain`.

:::info

You can refer to the [**wagmi docs**](https://wagmi.sh/vue/api/composables) for more information on the composables.
