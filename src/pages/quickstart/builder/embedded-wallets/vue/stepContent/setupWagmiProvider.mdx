### Set up the Wagmi provider

Since this example uses `@wagmi/vue`, wrap your app with the `WagmiProvider` component
from `@web3auth/modal/vue/wagmi`.

```tsx
import { WagmiProvider } from '@web3auth/modal/vue/wagmi'
```

This example uses the standard Wagmi setup. You don't need to create a Wagmi configuration; the Web3Auth
configuration is used directly. See the [Wagmi docs](https://wagmi.sh/vue/getting-started) for more
information.
