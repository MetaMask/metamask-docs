### Make blockchain calls

With the Embedded Wallets React Native SDK, you can derive the user's private key in memory for the
current session. Use that key for any blockchain using their corresponding library in the React
Native environment.

:::info Connect any blockchain

Refer to the [blockchain documentation](/embedded-wallets/connect-blockchain/) to learn more about making calls on
any supported blockchain.

This example uses the [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/cookbook/react-native/) library
to make calls to the Ethereum blockchain. Refer to the
[Ethereum in React Native](/embedded-wallets/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/react-native/) documentation
for more information.
