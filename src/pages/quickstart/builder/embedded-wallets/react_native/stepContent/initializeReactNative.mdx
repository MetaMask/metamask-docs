### Initialize the `Web3Auth` instance

[Initialize the `Web3Auth` instance](/embedded-wallets/sdk/react-native#initialize-web3auth) when your
app starts so users can sign in. During this step you'll pass the configuration options you need.

You'll need your client ID, the network you want to use, and the `redirectUrl` for your application.
Set up [deep linking](/embedded-wallets/sdk/react-native#setup) so the MetaMask Embedded
Wallets SDK can redirect users back to your app after authentication.
