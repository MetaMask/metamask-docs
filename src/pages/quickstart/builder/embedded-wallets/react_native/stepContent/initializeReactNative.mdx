### Initialize Web3Auth

Web3Auth needs to be initialized as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in. Preferably done within a constructor, initialization is the step where you can pass on all the configurations for Web3Auth you want.

For initializing Web3Auth React Native SDK, you need to provide your Client ID, the Web3Auth Network of your project and the `redirectUrl` for your application. Make sure to set up Deep Linking so that the Web3Auth SDK can redirect the user back to your application after authentication.
