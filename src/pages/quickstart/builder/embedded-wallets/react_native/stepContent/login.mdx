### Sign in your user

Use the `Web3Auth` instance [`login`](embedded-wallets/sdk/react-native/usage#logging-in-a-user) function
to sign in the user. You can create a button that triggers the `login` function for the sign in
method of their choice.

After a successful sign-in, the SDK stores the session state internally, and the user is redirected
back to your app.
