title: Setup Wagmi Provider
---

Since we're using `wagmi` for this example, we need to setup the `WagmiProvider` component. Please
use the `WagmiProvider` component from `@web3auth/modal/react/wagmi` to wrap your application.

```tsx
import { WagmiProvider } from "@web3auth/modal/react/wagmi";
```

> Apart from that, the standard wagmi setup is being used. You do not need to create any wagmi
> config, since the Web3Auth config is being used directly. Refer to the
> [wagmi docs](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started) for more information.
