title: Making Blockchain Calls
---

While using the Web3Auth React Native SDK, you get the private key within the user scope. This means
that you can use it with any blockchain with their corresponding library within the React Native
environment.

:::tip Reference

Have a look at our [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain/) section of the documentation and
choose your blockchain to get started.

In this example, we are using the [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/cookbook/react-native/)
library to make calls to the Ethereum blockchain. You can check out our
[Ethereum in React Native](/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/react-native) guide of the documentation
to get started.
