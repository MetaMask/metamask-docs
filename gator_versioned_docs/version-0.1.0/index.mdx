# MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit

The MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit enables developers to create new experiences based on programmable account behavior and granular permission sharing.
It offers a suite of contracts, libraries, and services designed for maximum composability, allowing developers to build and extend their dapps with ease.

## Build on MetaMask Smart Accounts

The toolkit enables embedding [MetaMask Smart Accounts](concepts/smart-accounts.md) into dapps.
Smart accounts support programmable account behavior and advanced features like delegated permissions, multi-signature approvals, and gas abstraction.

[Delegation](concepts/delegation/index.md) is a core feature of smart accounts, enabling secure, rule-based permission sharing.
Delegation is powered by the [Delegation Framework](https://github.com/metamask/delegation-framework), which defines how permissions are created, shared, and enforced.

## Request Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715)

The toolkit supports [Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715)](concepts/advanced-permissions.md), which are fine-grained permissions dapps can request from users directly via the MetaMask browser extension.
Advanced Permissions allow you to perform executions on the behalf of MetaMask users.
