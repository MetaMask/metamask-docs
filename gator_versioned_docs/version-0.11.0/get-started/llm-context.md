# Delegation Toolkit LLM context

This website contains [`LLMs.txt`](/llms.txt) and [`LLMs-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt) files that are intended for use by large language models (LLMs).
They provide information about the content and structure of the MetaMask Delegation Toolkit documentation,
to facilitate better indexing, summarization, and understanding by LLMs.

You can add these files to an LLM-based tool like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs),
to provide detailed context about the Delegation Toolkit.
