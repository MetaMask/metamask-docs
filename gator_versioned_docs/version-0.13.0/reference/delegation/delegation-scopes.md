# Delegation scopes

When [creating a delegation](../../guides/delegation/execute-on-smart-accounts-behalf.md), you can configure the following scopes to define the delegation's initial authority.
Learn [how to use delegation scopes](../../guides/delegation/use-delegation-scopes/index.md).

## Spending limit scopes

### ERC-20 periodic scope

Ensures a per-period limit for ERC-20 token transfers.
At the start of each new period, the allowance resets.


#### Parameters

| Name             | Type      | Required | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tokenAddress`   | `Address` | Yes      | The ERC-20 token contract address as a hex string.               |
| `periodAmount`   | `bigint`  | Yes      | The maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred per period. |
| `periodDuration` | `number`  | Yes      | The duration of each period in seconds.                          |
| `startDate`      | `number`  | Yes      | The timestamp when the first period begins in seconds.           |

#### Example

```typescript
import { createDelegation, getDelegatorEnvironment } from "@metamask/delegation-toolkit";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const delegation = createDelegation({
  scope: {
    type: "erc20PeriodTransfer",
    tokenAddress: "0xb4aE654Aca577781Ca1c5DE8FbE60c2F423f37da",
    periodAmount: 1000000000000000000n,
    periodDuration: 86400,
    startDate: 1743763600,
  },
  // Address that is granting the delegation
  from: "0x7E48cA6b7fe6F3d57fdd0448B03b839958416fC1",
  // Address to which the delegation is being granted
  to: "0x2B2dBd1D5fbeB77C4613B66e9F35dBfE12cB0488",
  // Alternatively you can use environment property of MetaMask smart account.
  environment: getDelegatorEnvironment(sepolia.id);
});
```

### ERC-20 streaming scope

Ensures a linear streaming transfer limit for ERC-20 tokens.
Token transfers are blocked until the defined start timestamp.
At the start, a specified initial amount is released, after which tokens accrue linearly at the configured rate, up to the maximum allowed amount.

#### Parameters

| Name              | Type      | Required | Description                                               |

| `tokenAddress`    | `Address` | Yes      | The ERC-20 token contract address.                        |
| `initialAmount`   | `bigint`  | Yes      | The initial amount that can be transferred at start time. |
| `maxAmount`       | `bigint`  | Yes      | The maximum total amount that can be unlocked.            |
| `amountPerSecond` | `bigint`  | Yes      | The rate at which tokens accrue per second.               |
| `startTime`       | `number`  | Yes      | The start timestamp in seconds.                           |

#### Example

```typescript
import { createDelegation, getDelegatorEnvironment } from "@metamask/delegation-toolkit";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const delegation = createDelegation({
  scope: {

    tokenAddress: "0xc11F3a8E5C7D16b75c9E2F60d26f5321C6Af5E92",
    amountPerSecond: 100n,
    initialAmount: 1000000n,
    maxAmount: 10000000n,
    startTime: 1703980800,
  },
  // Address that is granting the delegation
  from: "0x7E48cA6b7fe6F3d57fdd0448B03b839958416fC1",
  // Address to which the delegation is being granted
  to: "0x2B2dBd1D5fbeB77C4613B66e9F35dBfE12cB0488",

| `maxAmount`    | `bigint`  | Yes      | The maximum amount of tokens that can be transferred by delegate. |

#### Example

```typescript
import { createDelegation, getDelegatorEnvironment } from "@metamask/delegation-toolkit";
import { sepolia } from "viem/chains";

const delegation = createDelegation({
  scope: {
    type: "erc20TransferAmount",

    maxAmount: 10000n,
  },
  // Address that is granting the delegation
  from: "0x7E48cA6b7fe6F3d57fdd0448B03b839958416fC1",
  // Address to which the delegation is being granted
  to: "0x2B2dBd1D5fbeB77C4613B66e9F35dBfE12cB0488",
  // Alternatively you can use environment property of MetaMask smart account.
  environment: getDelegatorEnvironment(sepolia.id);
