# MetaMask Delegation Toolkit documentation

## Why use the toolkit?

The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit enables developers to create frictionless new experiences based
on granular permission sharing and trust.
The toolkit offers a suite of contracts, libraries, and services designed for maximum composability,
allowing developers to build and extend their dapps with ease.
The toolkit enables:

- **Instant user onboarding.** Provide frictionless onboarding with no browser extension, mobile
  app, or seed phrase required.

- **New web3 experiences.** Unlock new experiences such as peer-to-peer social
  coordination using incentive trees, or recurring subscription payments that don't require users
  to connect to the dapp.

- **Uninterrupted user experiences.** Keep users immersed in the dapp by embedding the wallet
  experience and reassigning gas costs to where they make sense.

The toolkit includes the [Delegation Framework](concepts/delegation.md#delegation-framework) – a
pioneering set of open-source, customizable smart contracts, allowing dapps and protocols to
implement custom permission control.
Developers can use the Delegation Framework to prepare their dapps for
[delegations](concepts/delegation.md) created from
[delegator accounts](concepts/delegator-accounts.md).
