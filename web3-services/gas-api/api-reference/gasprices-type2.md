# Get EIP-1559 gas prices

Returns the estimated [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) gas fees for the specified
blockchain network.

**GET** `https://gas.api.infura.io/networks/${chainId}/suggestedGasFees`

## Parameters

**Path**:

- `chainId`: _string_ - ID of the chain to query.

## Returns

Recommended gas price details based of the level of urgency:

- `low`, `medium`, `high`: _Object_ containing recommended values for transactions by level of urgency:
  - `suggestedMaxPriorityFeePerGas`: _string_ - The maximum suggested priority fee per gas to pay
    to have transactions included in a block.
  - `suggestedMaxFeePerGas`: _string_ - The maximum suggested total fee per gas to pay, including
    both the base fee and the priority fee.
  - `minWaitTimeEstimate`: _number_ - The minimum estimated wait time (in milliseconds) for a
    transaction to be included in a block at the suggested gas price.
  - `maxWaitTimeEstimate`: _number_ - The maximum estimated wait time (in milliseconds) for a
    transaction to be included in a block at the suggested gas price.
- `estimatedBaseFee`: _string_ - The current estimated base fee per gas on the network.
- `networkCongestion`: _number_ - The current congestion on the network, represented as a number
  between `0` and `1`.
  A lower network congestion score (for example `0.1`), indicates that fewer transactions are being
  submitted, so it's cheaper to validate transactions.
- `latestPriorityFeeRange`: _array_ - The range of priority fees per gas for recent transactions on
  the network.
- `historicalPriorityFeeRange`: _array_ - The range of priority fees per gas for transactions on the
  network over a historical period.
- `historicalBaseFeeRange`: _array_ - The range of base fees per gas on the network over a
  historical period.
- `priorityFeeTrend`: _string_ - The current trend in priority fees on the network, either `up` or
  `down` (whether it's getting more expensive or cheaper).
- `baseFeeTrend`: _string_ - The current trend in base fees on the network, either `up` or
  `down` (whether it's getting more expensive or cheaper).
