# Use Web3 services with your dapp

MetaMask, in partnership with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), offers a comprehensive set of Web3
services to facilitate dapp and Snap development.
This includes JSON-RPC APIs for easy access to key networks and REST APIs aimed at automating and
optimizing essential development tasks.
These Web3 services streamline development workflows to help developers build robust and successful
dapps and Snaps.

For example, you can use the [Gas API](gas-api/index.md) to gain real-time insights into the gas
market, optimizing your transactions for speed and cost-effectiveness.
