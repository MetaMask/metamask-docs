The [credit pricing model](../api/learn/pricing/) replaces request-based billing for free-tier (Core)
customers. Customers on Developer and Team plans will be transitioned to the credit model on
September 30, 2024.

**Existing customers on Growth and Custom plans will remain on request-based billing**.
:::

You can view your daily credit usage in relation to your daily credit quota limit. Daily credit usage
counts are reset everyday at 00:00 UTC for all customers.

Select **View Usage** from the **Daily Credit Usage** section on the Infura dashboard, or select
the **Usage** tab from the **Settings** > **Billing** dropdown.

View your usage for the previous 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days by methods used, networks, or API key.
