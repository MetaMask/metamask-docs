# Use MetaMask SDK with Electron

You can import [MetaMask SDK](../../../../concepts/sdk.md) into your Electron dapp to enable your users
to easily connect to the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile.

On the frontend, see the instructions to [use the SDK with React](react/index.md).
On the backend, see the instructions to [use the SDK with Node.js](nodejs.md).
