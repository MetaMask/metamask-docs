# Use MetaMask SDK with Android

MetaMask SDK support for native Android dapps is coming soon.
The SDK currently supports [React Native](../javascript/react-native.md) and [native iOS](ios.md)
mobile dapps, [JavaScript-based](../javascript/index.md) dapps, and [Unity](../gaming/unity.md)
gaming dapps.
