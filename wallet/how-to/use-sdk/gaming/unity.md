# Use MetaMask SDK with Unity

You can import MetaMask SDK into your [Unity](https://unity.com/) game to enable users to easily
connect to their MetaMask Mobile wallet.
The MetaMask Unity SDK supports macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and WebGL.

## How it works

The SDK renders a QR code in the Unity game UI using a dedicated prefab which players can scan with
their MetaMask Mobile app.
It also supports deeplinking on mobile platforms.
You can use all the [provider API methods](../../../reference/provider-api.md) right from your game.

## Video demo

The following video demonstrates how to install and use the MetaMask Unity SDK.

## Steps

### 1. Configure build settings

To build the SDK, configure the following settings in your Unity editor according to your
development platform:

- iOS:
  - Go to **Build Settings > Build Options** and set **Enable Bitcode** to **NO**.
- Android:
  - Go to the **Assets** dropdown menu and select **External Dependency Manager > Android
    Resolver > Resolve**.
  - Go to **Build Settings > Player Settings** and set **Minimum API level** to **Android 7.0
    'Nougat'** (API level 24).
- WebGL:
  - Go to **Build Settings > Player Settings**, switch to the **Resolution & Presentation Tab**, and
    select **MetaMask**.

For all platforms, also set the **Scripting Backend** in **Player Settings** to **IL2CPP**, and set
**IL2CPP Code Generation** in **Build Settings** to **Faster (smaller) builds**.

### 2. Install the SDK for Unity

Download the
[MetaMask SDK for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/decentralization/infrastructure/metamask-246786)
from the Unity Asset Store.

In your Unity editor, go to the menu > **Package Manager**.
Select **My Assets**, **MetaMask Unity SDK**, and **Install**.
You should see the MetaMask SDK package listed in the project packages and be able to interface
with it and its examples in the scene.

You also need to install [TextMeshPro](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.textmeshpro.html).
If you don't have TextMeshPro installed, the Unity editor automatically prompts you to install it.

### 3. Initialize MetaMask

The main class you interface with is called `MetaMaskWallet`.
It handles the connection to the user's wallet, as well as processing the requests to it using a
socket.io implementation.

To use it inside Unity, you must attach the component called `MetaMaskUnity` to a game object within
the editor.
This component is a singleton and you can use its `Instance` property to access the wallet instance.
You first must initialize by doing one of the following:

- Manually call `Initialize()`:

    ```csharp
    MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Initialize();
    ```

- Check **Initialize On Start** on the component within the editor.

This initializes the wallet instance, making it accessible from `MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Wallet`.
You can now make calls to the user's wallet using [provider API methods](../../../reference/provider-api.md).

### 4. Connect to MetaMask

Once the wallet is prepared and initialized, you can connect to MetaMask.
Call the `Connect()` method on the wallet instance as follows:

```csharp
var wallet = MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Wallet;
wallet.Connect();
```

You can also subscribe to the `OnWalletConnected` callback on the wallet instance to be notified
once the wallet is connected:

```csharp
wallet.WalletConnected += OnWalletConnected;

void OnWalletConnected(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    Debug.Log("Wallet is connected");
}
```

You can also use the `Connect()` method from `MetaMaskUnity` that delegates the call to the wallet
instance:

```csharp
MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Connect();
```

There are a variety of sample buttons included inside the package that call this method when clicked.
These are provided as a convenience to get started quickly with your project.
Once the connection request is made, a QR code is generated, and based on the transport you're using
(`Unity UI` by default), either a new Canvas that contains the QR code is spawned or the
`MetaMaskUnityUIQRImage` generates the QR code when the connection is requested.

If you want to use the latter, add an instance of the `MetaMaskUnityUIQRImage` component to the
scene with its fields provided.
The transport field is also required if you want to use it isolated from the canvas that is spawned
by the transport, then it generates the QR code for you.

### 5. Use MetaMask

Once the wallet is authorized, you can make requests to it.
The wallet is authorized when the buttons become interactable or the `WalletAuthorized` event is fired:

```csharp
var wallet = MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Wallet;
wallet.WalletAuthorized += OnWalletAuthorized;

void OnWalletAuthorized(object sender, EventArgs e) {
    Debug.Log("Wallet is authorized");
}
```

You can call any Ethereum request on the wallet using `wallet.Request(myRequest)`.
The following is a sample transaction request:

```csharp
var wallet = MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Wallet;
var transactionParams = new MetaMaskTransaction
{
    To = "0xd0059fB234f15dFA9371a7B45c09d451a2dd2B5a",
    From = MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Wallet.SelectedAddress,
    Value = "0x0"
};

var request = new MetaMaskEthereumRequest
{
    Method = "eth_sendTransaction",
    Parameters = new MetaMaskTransaction[] { transactionParams }
};
await wallet.Request(request);
```

### 6. Configure MetaMask

You can customize the default configuration or create your own configuration.

Edit the default configuration by doing one of the following:

- Navigate to the **Window > MetaMask > Setup** menu item.
- Open the `MetaMaskConfig` asset in the project window.

Edit the fields and save the changes.

Create a new configuration by right-clicking on the project window and navigating to
**MetaMask > Config**.
Name the new configuration and use it when initializing the `MetaMaskUnity` instance.

## API

The following is an overview of the APIs from the most important classes.

### MetaMaskUnity

This is a singleton class that you can use to access the `MetaMaskWallet` instance, which is
specific to Unity.

#### `Instance`

This is the singleton instance of the `MetaMaskUnity` class that is lazy-loaded when you access it
for the first time.

#### `Initialize`

This method initializes the `MetaMaskWallet` instance and makes it accessible via the `Wallet` property.
You can also pass extra options and parameters to it to customize the wallet instance:

```csharp
// Initialize using default settings
MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Initialize();

// Initialize using custom transport and socket provider
var transport = new MyCustomTransport();
var socketProvider = new MyCustomSocketProvider();
MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Initialize(transport, socketProvider);

// Initialize using custom config, transport and socket provider
var config = myMetaMaskConfig;
var transport = new MyCustomTransport();
var socketProvider = new MyCustomSocketProvider();
MetaMaskUnity.Instance.Initialize(config, transport, socketProvider);
```

#### `SaveSession`

This method saves the current session to the persistent storage.
This is useful when you want to save the session and restore it later.
This is automatically called when the application quits, but you can also manually call it.

#### `LoadSession`

This method loads the session from the persistent storage.
This is useful when you want to restore the session after the application quits.
This is automatically called when the application starts, but you can also manually call it.

### MetaMaskWallet

#### `Connect`

This method connects to the MetaMask app.
It renders a generated QR code in the user interface for your users to scan with MetaMask Mobile.
After the user scans this QR code, a connect screen appears in MetaMask Mobile where the user can
approve the connection with your game application.

#### `Disconnect`

This method disconnects the user that is connected from the MetaMask app session.

#### `Request`

This method sends a request to MetaMask.
You can use it to call any [provider API method](../../../reference/provider-api.md).

## FAQS

<details>

<summary>I can't find the SDK installation option.</summary>

If you don't see the option to [install the SDK](#2-install-the-sdk-for-unity) in your Unity menu,
ensure you're on the latest Unity version and that you have no red errors printed in your console.
This option not appearing is typically due to incorrect editor initialization, which you can
usually resolve by restarting the editor or updating your Unity version.

</details>

<details>

<summary>On iOS, why does a popup appear when using a deeplink?</summary>

When deeplinking, a background service is created to facilitate the communication layer between the
Unity game and MetaMask.
On iOS, background services expire after a certain amount of time.
A notification pops up to let you know the socket connection has expired.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What does the external dependency manager do?</summary>

The Unity Jar Resolver is an external dependency manager specifically for Unity projects that use
external libraries.
It helps manage the dependencies between Unity and external libraries, which can sometimes be
complicated due to differences between the two environments.
This tool is particularly useful for MetaMask SDK, since Android and iOS need a variety of native
libraries to facilitate deeplinking and the persistent socket connection.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does the SDK increase my compilation time?</summary>

No.
If you notice an increased compilation time, it might be related to the ILL2CP pipeline, which can
take longer to build at compile time.
The SDK is filled with precompiled libraries to save on runtime compilation.
