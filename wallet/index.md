# Integrate your dapp with the MetaMask wallet

Integrate your dapp with MetaMask to interact with your dapp users' Ethereum accounts.
You can enable users to connect to their MetaMask wallets from the following dapp platforms:

- Web dapps on desktop and mobile browsers
- Desktop and mobile dapps
- Games built on platforms such as Unity

:::tip Integrate using MetaMask SDK
[Set up MetaMask SDK](how-to/connect/set-up-sdk/index.md) to start integrating your dapp with MetaMask.
[MetaMask SDK](concepts/sdk.md) is a library that provides a reliable, secure, and seamless
connection from your dapp to the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile.

With the SDK installed, your dapp can use the [MetaMask Ethereum provider API](concepts/provider-api.md)
to request users' Ethereum accounts, read data from blockchains the user is connected to, suggest
that the user sign messages and transactions, and more.

## New to dapp development?

If you're new to dapp development or want to refresh your knowledge, we recommend starting with the
following guides:

- [Get started building a dapp](how-to/get-started-building)
- [Connect to MetaMask](how-to/connect)

For an end-to-end example, you can also follow the
[Create a simple React dapp](tutorials/react-dapp-local-state.md) tutorial.

## Want to use advanced features?

If you're a developer looking to optimize your dapp for MetaMask, you can
[connect to MetaMask](how-to/connect) from an existing dapp and implement MetaMask-specific
functions, including:

- [Sign data](how-to/sign-data)
- [Display tokens, contract methods, and icons in MetaMask](how-to/display)
- [Interact with smart contracts](how-to/interact-with-smart-contracts.md)
- [Access a user's MetaMask provider](how-to/access-provider.md)
