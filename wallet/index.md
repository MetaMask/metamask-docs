# Integrate your dapp with the MetaMask wallet

MetaMask provides powerful tools for connecting dapps to wallets. With **MetaMask SDK**, developers can easily create seamless wallet connections across desktop and mobile platforms. The **Wallet API** offers flexibility in interacting with wallets and blockchain networks using standardized JSON-RPC calls, enabling direct access to key functionalities.

Get started by [connecting to MetaMask](connect/index.md).

## Why use MetaMask SDK?

**MetaMask SDK** allows you to establish a reliable connection between your dapp and the MetaMask browser extension or MetaMask Mobile, providing cross-platform compatibility with a consistent user experience. Key benefits include:

- **Cross-platform compatibility** – Integrate with MetaMask from desktop, iOS, Android, React Native, and more.
- **Seamless connections** – Minimize reconnections and improve user experience, especially on mobile.
- **Mobile-first optimization** – Enable faster wallet interactions with instant deeplinks and advanced features.
- **Enhanced functionality** – Use [RPC request batching](how-to/batch-json-rpc-requests.md), [EIP-6963](/wallet/concepts/wallet-interoperability.md) for wallet discovery, and wallet security enhancements.

For more control, the **Wallet API** allows developers to interact with wallets, manage Ethereum accounts, and call JSON-RPC methods, with or without the SDK.
