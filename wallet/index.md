# Integrate your dapp with the MetaMask wallet

Integrate your dapp with MetaMask using **MetaMask SDK** and the **Wallet API**.
Use MetaMask SDK to create a seamless connection between your dapp and MetaMask across desktop and mobile platforms.
Use the Wallet API to interact with users' Ethereum accounts in MetaMask.

Get started by [connecting to MetaMask](connect/index.md).

## Why use MetaMask SDK?

**MetaMask SDK** enables a reliable, secure, and seamless connection between your dapp and the MetaMask browser extension or MetaMask Mobile, providing cross-platform compatibility with a consistent user experience. Key benefits include:

- **Multi-platform support** – Connect from web, desktop, mobile, and gaming platforms.
- **Seamless connections** – Minimize reconnections and improve user experience, especially on mobile.
- **Mobile-first optimization** – Enable faster wallet interactions with instant deeplinks and advanced features.
- **Enhanced functionality** – Use [RPC request batching](how-to/batch-json-rpc-requests.md), [EIP-6963](/wallet/concepts/wallet-interoperability.md) for wallet discovery, and wallet security enhancements.

The **Wallet API** allows you to interact with users' Ethereum accounts using standardized JSON-RPC calls.
While you can connect to MetaMask directly using just the Wallet API, we recommend using the SDK with the Wallet API to take advantage of the SDK's benefits.

## Where do I start?
