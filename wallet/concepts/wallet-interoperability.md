# Wallet interoperability

A web dapp can integrate with multiple installed browser wallets simultaneously by adding support for
[EIP-6963](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963), which introduces an alternative wallet detection
mechanism to the [`window.ethereum`](wallet-api.md#ethereum-provider-api) injected provider.
This mechanism is enabled by using the standardized interfaces defined by EIP-6963.

The following is a demo of the user experience of detecting multiple wallets, showing the data
provided from each installed wallet:

</p>

You can [connect to MetaMask using EIP-6963](../how-to/connect/index.md) and see the
[EIP-6963 Vite React + TypeScript demo](https://github.com/MetaMask/vite-react-ts-eip-6963/tree/main)
for more information.

## EIP-6963 interfaces

Wallets that support EIP-6963 implement and expose the following standardized interfaces.
When [connecting to MetaMask using EIP-6963](../how-to/connect/index.md), it's important to review
and understand these interfaces.

### Provider info

The [`EIP6963ProviderInfo`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963#provider-info) interface
represents the assets needed to display a wallet:

- `uuid` - The wallet ID ([UUIDv4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122)).
- `name` - A human-readable name of the wallet.
- `icon` - A [URI](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986) pointing to an icon of the wallet.
- `rdns` - The wallet's domain name.

### Provider detail

The [`EIP6963ProviderDetail`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963#provider-detail) interface
represents additional metadata about the wallet:

- `info` - The [`EIP6963ProviderInfo`](#provider-info).
- `provider` - The `EIP1193Provider` defined by [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193).

### Announce and request events

The [`EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963#announce-and-request-events)
interface announces an event dispatched by the wallet:

```typescript
interface EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent extends CustomEvent {
    type: "eip6963:announceProvider";
    detail: EIP6963ProviderDetail;
}
```

The [`EIP6963RequestProviderEvent`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963#announce-and-request-events)
interface requests an event dispatched by a dapp:

```typescript
interface EIP6963RequestProviderEvent extends Event {
    type: "eip6963:requestProvider";
}
```

## Third-party library support

The following third-party libraries support EIP-6963:

- [Wagmi 2+](https://wagmi.sh)
- [Web3Modal 3+](https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/about)
- [MIPD Store](https://github.com/wevm/mipd)
- [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)

### MIPD Store

The [MIPD Store](https://github.com/wevm/mipd) stores the wallet providers and enables you to
subscribe to the store and retrieve the providers.
Unlike [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) and [Web3-Onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/), which are
libraries that provide components and connectors for multiple wallets and depend on MetaMask SDK for
integration, the MIPD Store is a utility library that makes it easier to work with EIP-6963 and
supports TypeScript types.

## MetaMask SDK support

:::note
MetaMask SDK does not support connecting to non-MetaMask wallets via EIP-6963.
If you intend to support discovery of other wallets, we recommend using other methods of adding
EIP-6963 support such as [Wagmi 2+](https://wagmi.sh).
:::

The [MetaMask JavaScript SDK](../how-to/use-sdk/javascript/index.md) automatically checks
for the presence of the MetaMask extension via EIP-6963.
This eliminates the need for manual configuration or detection methods, simplifying the initial
setup process for both developers and users.

By adhering to the standards set by EIP-6963, the SDK unambiguously identifies and connects to
MetaMask, resolving potential conflicts that might arise with other wallet extensions, ensuring a
more stable and reliable interaction for users.

The SDK is also being integrated into [Wagmi 2+](https://wagmi.sh/), which supports EIP-6963.
The SDK on its own supports connecting *only* to MetaMask via EIP-6963, so if you intend to support
discovery of other wallets, we recommend using other methods of adding EIP-6963 support, such as
Wagmi 2+.

## Wallet support

The EIP-6963 alternative discovery mechanism works for wallets that have implemented support for EIP-6963.
This includes MetaMask, Coinbase, Trust Wallet, OKX, and other major wallets.
See the [list of wallets that support EIP-6963](https://github.com/WalletConnect/EIP6963/blob/master/src/utils/constants.ts).

## Backwards compatibility

Dapps that do not support EIP-6963 can still
[detect MetaMask using the `window.ethereum` provider](../how-to/connect/detect-metamask.md).
However, we recommend adding support to improve the user experience for multiple installed wallets.
