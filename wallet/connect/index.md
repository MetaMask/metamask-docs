# Connect to MetaMask

You can connect your dapp to MetaMask using one of the following methods:

- [MetaMask SDK](metamask-sdk/index.md)
- Third-party libraries with SDK support, such as [Wagmi](3rd-party-libraries/wagmi.md) or
  [Web3-Onboard](3rd-party-libraries/web3-onboard.md)
- The [Wallet API](wallet-api.md) directly

The following table compares the supported features of each connection option:

## MetaMask SDK

MetaMask SDK enables a reliable, secure, and seamless connection between your dapp and the MetaMask
browser extension or MetaMask Mobile.
You can call any Wallet API method from a dapp with the SDK installed, and you can integrate the SDK
into existing projects without modifying existing Wallet API calls.

Key features include:

- **Multi-platform support** – Connect from web, desktop, mobile, and gaming platforms.
- **Seamless mobile integration** – Use QR codes or deeplinks to establish persistent connections
  with MetaMask Mobile.
- **EIP-6963 detection** – Automatically detect MetaMask without conflicting with other installed wallets.
- **RPC request batching** – Improve efficiency by batching multiple requests into a single call.

Get started using [MetaMask SDK](metamask-sdk/index.md).

## Third-party libraries

MetaMask SDK integrates seamlessly with libraries like Wagmi and Web3-Onboard, simplifying wallet
connections and supporting multiple wallets.
These libraries streamline connection logic and offer additional features for managing wallets.

:::note Trade-offs when using third-party libraries:
- Reduced control over specific MetaMask features.
- Potential inconsistencies across different wallets due to multi-wallet support.
:::

Get started with [Wagmi](3rd-party-libraries/wagmi.md) or
[Web3-Onboard](3rd-party-libraries/web3-onboard.md).

## Wallet API

The Wallet API consists of an [Ethereum Provider API](../reference/provider-api.md) and a
[JSON-RPC API](/wallet/reference/json-rpc-api), which allow you to interact with users' EVM accounts
in MetaMask.
For most dapps, we recommend integrating with MetaMask using the SDK or third-party libraries in
conjunction with the Wallet API, to take advantage of the SDK's benefits.
However, you can also connect to the MetaMask extension directly using the Wallet API.

Get started with the [Wallet API](wallet-api.md).
