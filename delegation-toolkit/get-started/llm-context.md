# Delegation Toolkit LLM context

This website contains an [`LLMs.txt`](/llms.txt) file that is intended for use by large language models (LLMs).
It provides information about the structure of the MetaMask developer documentation,
to facilitate better indexing, summarization, and understanding by LLMs.

You can add this file to an LLM-based tool like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs),
to provide detailed context about the MetaMask developer documentation.
