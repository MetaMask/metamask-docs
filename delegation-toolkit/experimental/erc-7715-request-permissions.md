# ERC-7715: Request permissions

:::caution Experimental
This is an experimental feature.
It requires MetaMask Flask 12.14.2 or later, and may change in future releases.
:::

[ERC-7715](https://eip.tools/eip/7715) introduces a standard way for dapps to request permissions from a wallet to execute
transactions on a user's behalf.

The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit provides the experimental actions for ERC-7715 that lets a caller request permissions from MetaMask's permissions system.

## Request permissions

To request permissions, extend your [Viem Wallet Client](https://viem.sh/docs/clients/wallet) with `erc7715ProviderActions` actions.
You'll need a session account to request the permission, which can be either a smart account or an externally owned account (EOA).
This example uses a smart account:

<TabItem value="example.ts">

```typescript
import { sepolia as chain } from "viem/chains";
import { sessionAccount, walletClient } from "./config.ts";

const expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000 + 604_800); // 1 week from now.
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); // now

const grantedPermissions = await walletClient.grantPermissions([{
  chainId: chain.id,
  expiry,
  signer: {
    type: "account",
    data: {
      address: sessionAccount.address,
    },
  },
  permission: {
    type: "native-token-stream",
    data: {
      initialAmount: 1n, // 1 wei
      amountPerSecond: 1n, // 1 wei per second
      maxAmount: 10n, // 10 wei
      startTime: currentTime,
      justification: "Payment for a week long subscription",
    },
  },
}]);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="config.ts">

```typescript
import { createWalletClient, custom, createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { generatePrivateKey, privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { sepolia as chain } from "viem/chains";
import { erc7715ProviderActions } from "@metamask/delegation-toolkit/experimental";
import { toMetaMaskSmartAccount, Implementation } from "@metamask/delegation-toolkit";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  chain: chain,
  transport: http(),
});

// The private key of the session owner.
const privateKey = "0x...";
const account = privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);

export const sessionAccount = await toMetaMaskSmartAccount({
  client: publicClient,
  implementation: Implementation.Hybrid,
  deployParams: [account.address, [], [], []],
  deploySalt: "0x",
  signatory: { account },
});

export const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
}).extend(erc7715ProviderActions());
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

  Here's what your ERC-7715 native token streaming allowance request looks like:

  ```ts
  [{
    chainId: "0xaa36a7",
    expiry: 1745041429,
    permission: {
      type: "native-token-stream",
      data: {
        amountPerSecond: "0x1",
        maxAmount: "0x1",
        initialAmount: "0xa",
        startTime: 1744955029,
        justification: "Payment for a week long subscription",
      },
    },
    signer: {
      type: "account",
      data: {
        address: "0x1234...",
      },
    },
  }]
  ```

Additionally, you can allow users to modify the requested permission by setting the `isAdjustmentAllowed` parameter to `true` in the request.

```typescript
import { sepolia as chain } from "viem/chains";
// The config.ts is the same as in the previous example.
import { sessionAccount, walletClient } from "./config.ts";

const expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000 + 604_800); // 1 week from now.
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); // now

const grantedPermissions = await walletClient.grantPermissions([{
  chainId: chain.id,
  expiry,
  signer: {
    type: "account",
    data: {
      address: sessionAccount.address,
    },
  },
  permission: {
    type: "native-token-stream",
    // add-next-line
+   isAdjustmentAllowed: true,
    data: {
      initialAmount: 1n, // 1 wei
      amountPerSecond: 1n, // 1 wei per second
      maxAmount: 10n, // 10 wei
      startTime: currentTime,
      justification: "Payment for a week long subscription",
    },
  },
}]);
```

:::note
Users have full control over the permissions they grantâ€”depending on the permission you request, they may choose to grant more limited permissions than requested.
You should always verify the granted permissions and adjust your dapp's behavior accordingly.

## Security considerations for `accountMeta`

When a user grants a permission, they can provide [`accountMeta`](erc-7710-redeem-delegations.md#extract-relevant-data) which is an array of `factory` and `factoryData` values.
These calls must be executed before redeeming the permission (this is handled for you in `sendUserOperationWithDelegation`).

Because each `accountMeta` is an arbitrary call specified by the granter, it is important that these are executed carefully.
We recommend taking the following precautions:

- **Only grant permissions to session accounts** - When requesting permissions, use an account that is only used for that single purpose, and does not contain tokens.
  This way, any `accountMeta` executed can't perform any damaging actions.

- **Only execute `accountMeta` against trusted factory addresses** - Ensure that only `accountMeta` targeting a known factory address is executed.
  The bundler action `sendUserOperationWithDelegation` only executes `accountMeta` that targets the `SimpleFactory` address for the current Delegation Framework.
  If you redeem delegations in any other way, it is your responsibility to validate trusted factory addresses.

## Next steps

You can redeem the granted permission using the experimental [ERC-7710 `erc7710WalletActions()`](erc-7710-redeem-delegations.md).
