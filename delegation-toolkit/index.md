# Embed MetaMask Smart Accounts using the Delegation Toolkit

The MetaMask Delegation Toolkit is a [Viem](https://viem.sh/)-based collection of tools for embedding [MetaMask Smart Accounts](concepts/smart-accounts.md) into dapps.
Smart accounts support programmable account behavior and advanced features like delegated permissions, multi-signature approvals, and gas abstraction.

[Delegation](concepts/delegation/index.md) is a core feature of MetaMask Smart Accounts, enabling secure, rule-based permission sharing.
Delegation is powered by the toolkit's Delegation Framework, which defines how
permissions are created, shared, and enforced.

## Why use the toolkit?

The toolkit enables developers to create frictionless new experiences based on programmable account behavior and granular permission
sharing. The toolkit offers a suite of contracts, libraries, and services designed for
maximum composability, allowing developers to build and extend their dapps with ease.

The toolkit enables:

- **Instant user onboarding.** Instantly onboard users with embedded MetaMask Smart Accounts â€” no browser extension, mobile
  app, or seed phrase required.

- **New web3 experiences.** Unlock new experiences such as peer-to-peer social
  coordination using incentive trees, or recurring subscription payments that don't require users
  to connect to the dapp.

- **Uninterrupted user experiences.** Keep users immersed in the dapp by embedding the wallet
  experience and reassigning gas costs to where they make sense.
