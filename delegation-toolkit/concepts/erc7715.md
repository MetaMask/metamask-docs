# ERC-7715 permissions

The Delegation Toolkit supports [ERC-7715](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7715), which lets you request fine-grained permissions from a MetaMask user to execute transactions on their behalf.
For example, a user can grant your dapp permission to spend 10 USDC per day to buy ETH over the course of a month.
Once the permission is granted, your dapp can use the allocated 10 USDC each day to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask user's account.

ERC-7715 eliminates the need for users to approve every transaction, which is useful for highly interactive dapps.
It also enables dapps to execute transactions for users without an active wallet connection.

:::note
This feature requires [MetaMask Flask 12.14.2](/snaps/get-started/install-flask) or later.

## ERC-7715 permissions lifecycle

The ERC-7715 permissions lifecycle is as follows:

1. **Set up a session account** - Set up a session account to execute transactions on behalf of the MetaMask user.
  It can be a [smart account](smart-accounts.md) or an externally owned account (EOA).

2. **Request permissions** - Request permissions from the user.
  MetaMask supports multiple ERC-7715 [permission types](#permission-types).

3. **Set up a Viem client** - Set up a Viem client (the client type depends on the session account type) to redeem permissions.

4. **Redeem permissions** - Once the permission is granted, the session account redeems the permission.

See [how to perform executions on a MetaMask user's behalf](../guides/erc7715/execute-on-metamask-user-behalf.md) to get started with the ERC-7715 lifecycle.

## Permission types

The Delegation Toolkit currently supports the following types of ERC-7715 permissions:

- **Native token permissions** - Define how dapps can use users' native tokens.

- **ERC-20 token permissions** - Define how dapps can use users' ERC-20 tokens.

## ERC-7715 permissions vs. delegation

Requesting and redeeming ERC-7715 permissions differ from [creating and redeeming delegations](delegation/index.md).
