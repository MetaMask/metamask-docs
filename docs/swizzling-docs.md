# Swizzling Documentation

This document outlines the components that have been swizzled in this project. The swizzling process is separated into two main categories: Wrapping and Ejecting.

## Wrapping

The following components have been swizzled by wrapping:

- `Admonition/Type/Layout` (Safe) Used to add the cut-off-corners style to the Info boxes

- `DocCardList` (Safe) Used to add styles to the overview page cards + the arrow button

- `TOCItems` (Safe) Used to add the label "Table of contents:" on top of the right sidebar
