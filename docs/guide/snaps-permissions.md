To access certain powerful JavaScript globals or JSON-RPC methods, your snap will need to ask the user for permission. Snaps follow the [EIP-2255 wallet permissions specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2255), and your snap's required permissions must be specified in the `initialPermissions` field of your [`snap.manifest.json` file](./snaps-development-guide.md#the-snap-manifest).

## Endowments

### `endowment:rpc`

For snaps that need to handle arbitrary JSON-RPC requests, the `rpc` endowment is required. This permission grants a snap access to JSON-RPC requests sent to the snap, using the `onRpcRequest` method. See [Exports](./snaps-exports.html#onrpcrequest) for more information.

This permission requires an object with a `snaps` or `dapps` property (or both), to signal if the snap can receive JSON-RPC requests from other snaps, or dapps, respectively. Both values default to `false`.

```json
{
  "initialPermissions": {
    "endowment:rpc": {
      "dapps": true,
      "snaps": false
    }
  }
}
```

### `endowment:long-running`

For snaps that are computationally heavy and can't finish execution within [the snap lifecycle requirements](./snaps-development-guide.md#the-snap-lifecycle), the snap can request the `endowment:long-running` permission.
This permission will effectively allow snaps to run indefinitely while processing RPC requests.

### `endowment:network-access`

For snaps that need to access the internet, the snap can request the `endowment:network-access` permission. This permission will expose the global networking APIs `fetch` and `WebSocket` to the snap execution environment. Without this permission, these globals will not be available.

::: warning Avoid XMLHttpRequest
`XMLHttpRequest` is never available in snaps, and you should replace it with `fetch`. If your dependencies are using `XMLHttpRequest`, you can learn how to patch it away [here](./snaps-patching-dependencies.md#patching-the-use-of-xmlhttprequest).

### `endowment:transaction-insight`

For snaps that provide transaction insights, the snap can request the `endowment:transaction-insight` permission. This permission grants a snap read-only access to raw transaction payloads, before they are accepted for signing by the user, by exporting the `onTransaction` method. See [Exports](./snaps-exports.html#ontransaction) for more information.

This permission requires an object with an `allowTransactionOrigin` property to signal if the snap should pass the `transactionOrigin` property as part of the `onTransaction` parameters. This property represents the transaction initiator origin. Default to `false`.

```json
{
  "endowment:transaction-insight": {
    "allowTransactionOrigin": true
  }
}
```

### `endowment:cronjob`

For snaps that wants to run periodic actions for the user, the snap can request the `endowment:cronjob` permission. This permission allows a snap to specify periodic requests that will trigger the exported `onCronjob` method. see [Exports](./snaps-exports.html#oncronjob).

Cronjobs are specified as follows:

```json
{
  "initialPermissions": {
    "endowment:cronjob": {
      "jobs": [
        {
          "expression": {
            "minute": "*",
            "hour": "*",
            "dayOfMonth": "*",
            "month": "*",
            "dayOfWeek": "*"
          },
          "request": {
            "method": "exampleMethodOne",
            "params": {
              "param1": "foo"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "expression": "* * * * *",
          "request": {
            "method": "exampleMethodTwo",
            "params": {
              "param1": "bar"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### `endowment:ethereum-provider`

For snaps that wish to communicate with a node via MetaMask, the snap can request the `endowment:ethereum-provider` permission. This permission will expose the global API `ethereum` to the snap execution environment. Without this permission, this global will not be available. This global is a EIP-1193 provider.

## RPC Permissions

To use any restricted RPC method, a snap will need to request permissions to access that method. For a list of available RPC methods and thus valid RPC permissions see [JSON-RPC API](./snaps-rpc-api.html#restricted-methods).
