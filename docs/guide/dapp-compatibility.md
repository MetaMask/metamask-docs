# Dapp Compatibility

Include MetaMask mobile as a listed wallet in your application, and link to open MetaMask app (if installed) or to go to play/app store (if not yet installed).

Please direct your users to either the listing on their preferred app store, or to [our homepage](https://metamask.io/download.html) to download MetaMask mobile.

Support the MetaMask inpage provider and test that your integration works well.
