# Common Terms

## Words are Hard

Every field has its terminology, and every specialization has its acronyms. You can't escape it.

The decentralized web is certainly no exception, and if you're new to Web3, take a gander at MetaMask's [introduction to blockchain article](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489611) in our knowledgebase.

And no matter what your experience level, bookmark [ConsenSys' blockchain glossary](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/a-blockchain-glossary-for-beginners/), an amalgamation of many sources of information that is regularly updated.

While the above glossary is in the process of being translated, you can read an older version of this glossary in Spanish [consulte aquí una versión antigua de este glosario en español](https://github.com/faraggi/words-are-hard-es/blob/master/words-are-hard-es.md), thanks to [faraggi](https://github.com/faraggi).
