# Deeplinking

[Create deeplinks for your application here](https://metamask.github.io/metamask-deeplinks/#)

Deeplinks allow you to put your users into a specific context that you want within your application.

URLs embedded in QR-codes, hyperlinks in web-pages, emails or chat messages provide for robust cross-application signaling between very loosely coupled applications. A standardized URL format for payment requests allows for instant invocation of the user's preferred wallet application (even if it is a webapp or a swarm Ä‘app), with the correct parameterization of the payment transaction only to be confirmed by the (authenticated) user.
