# Provider Migration Guide

::: tip Attention MetaMask Users
If you are a MetaMask user attempting to use a legacy Ethereum website that hasn't migrated to the new API,
please see the section on the [MetaMask Legacy Web3 Extension](#using-the-metamask-legacy-web3-extension).

Except for such legacy websites, no action is required for MetaMask users.
:::

In January of 2021, we made a number of breaking changes to our provider API, and removed our injected `window.web3`.
These changes are live on all platforms as of version:

- `9.0.2` of the MetaMask browser extension
- `1.0.9` of MetaMask Mobile

This guide describes how to migrate to the new provider API, and how to replace our `window.web3`.
To understand why we made these changes, please see [this blog post](https://medium.com/metamask/breaking-changes-to-the-metamask-provider-are-here-7b11c9388be9).

## Summary of Breaking Changes

### `window.web3` Removal

As part of the breaking changes, we stopped injecting `web3.js` version `0.20.7` as `window.web3` into web pages.
MetaMask still injects a dummy object at `window.web3`, in order to issue warnings when websites attempt to access `window.web3`.

### `window.ethereum` API Changes

We made the following breaking changes to the `window.ethereum` API:

- Ensure that chain IDs returned by `eth_chainId` are **not** 0-padded
  - For example, instead of `0x01`, we always return `0x1`, wherever the chain ID is returned or accessible.
  - Note that this _only_ affects the [default Ethereum chains](./ethereum-provider.html#chain-ids), _except_ Kovan, whose chain ID is formatted correctly (`0x2a`).
- Stop emitting `chainIdChanged`, and instead emit `chainChanged`
- Remove the following experimental methods:
  - `ethereum._metamask.isEnabled`
  - `ethereum._metamask.isApproved`
- Remove the `ethereum.publicConfigStore` object
  - This object was, despite its name, never intended for public consumption.
    Its removal _may_ affect those who do not use it directly, e.g. if another library you use relies on the object.
- Remove the `ethereum.autoRefreshOnNetworkChange` property
  - Consumers can still set this property on the provider, it just won't do anything.
- Deprecate the `web3.currentProvider` method
  - Use [@metamask/detect-provider](https://github.com/MetaMask/detect-provider) to detect the current provider.

## Replacing `window.web3`

::: warning Pages No Longer Reload on Chain Changes
Since we removed our `window.web3`, MetaMask no longer automatically reloads the page on chain/network changes.

Please see [Handling the Removal of `ethereum.autoRefreshOnNetworkChange`](#handling-the-removal-of-ethereum-autorefreshonnetworkchange) for details.
:::

For historical reasons, MetaMask injected [`web3@0.20.7`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/tree/0.20.7) into all web pages.
That version of `web3` is deprecated, [has known security issues](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/3065), and is no longer maintained by the [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) team.
Therefore, we decided to remove this library.

If your website relied on our `window.web3` object, you have to migrate.
Please continue reading to understand your options.
Some are as simple as a one-line change.

::: tip Tip
Regardless of how you choose to migrate, you may want to read the `web3@0.20.7` documentation, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md).
:::

### Using `window.ethereum` Directly

For many web3 sites, the API provided by `window.ethereum` is sufficient.
Much of the `web3` API simply maps to RPC methods, all of which can be requested using [`ethereum.request()`](./ethereum-provider.html#ethereum-request-args).
For example, here are a couple of actions performed using first `window.web3`, and then their equivalents using `window.ethereum`.

<<< @/docs/snippets/web3ToProvider.js

### Using an Updated Convenience library

If you decide that you need a convenience library, you have to convert your usage of `window.web3` to an updated convenience library.
We recommend [`ethers`](https://npmjs.com/package/ethers) ([documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/)).

### Using `@metamask/legacy-web3`

::: warning
We strongly recommend that you consider one of the other two migration paths before resorting to this one.
It is not future-proof, and we will not add new features to it.
:::

Finally, if you just want your web3 site to continue to work, we created [`@metamask/legacy-web3`](https://npmjs.com/package/@metamask/legacy-web3).
This package is a drop-in replacement for our `window.web3` that you can add to your website even before remove `window.web3` on all platforms.

`@metamask/legacy-web3` should work exactly like our injected `window.web3`, including by refreshing the page on chain/network changes, but _we cannot guarantee that it works perfectly_.
We will not fix any future incompatibilities between `web3@0.20.7` and MetaMask itself, nor will we fix any bugs in `web3@0.20.7` itself.

For installation and usage instructions, please see the [npm listing](https://npmjs.com/package/@metamask/legacy-web3).

### Using the MetaMask Legacy Web3 Extension

We created the [**MetaMask Legacy Web3 Extension**](https://github.com/MetaMask/legacy-web3-extension) for any users of websites that still expect `window.web3` to be injected. If you install this extension alongside the regular MetaMask wallet extension, websites that rely on our old window.web3 API should start working again.

As with the regular extension, itâ€™s critical that you only install from the official browser extension stores. Please follow the relevant link below to install the Legacy Web3 extension in your browser:

- [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/metamask-legacy-web3/obkfjbjkiofoponpkmphnpaaadebfloh?hl=en-US)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/metamask-legacy-web3/)

## Migrating to the New Provider API

### Handling `eth_chainId` Return Values

The `eth_chainId` RPC method now returns correctly formatted values, e.g. `0x1` and `0x2`, instead of _incorrectly_ formatted values, e.g. `0x01` and `0x02`.
MetaMask's implementation of `eth_chainId` used to return 0-padded values for the [default Ethereum chains](./ethereum-provider.html#chain-ids) _except_ Kovan.
If you expect 0-padded chain ID values from `eth_chainId`, make sure to update your code to expect the correct format instead.

For more details on chain IDs and how to handle them, see the [`chainChanged` event](./ethereum-provider.html#chainchanged).

### Handling the Removal of `chainIdChanged`

`chainIdChanged` is a typo of `chainChanged`.
To migrate, simply listen for `chainChanged` instead:

```javascript
// Instead of this:
ethereum.on('chainIdChanged', (chainId) => {
  /* handle the chainId */
});

// Do this:
ethereum.on('chainChanged', (chainId) => {
  /* handle the chainId */
});
```

### Handling the Removal of `isEnabled()` and `isApproved()`

Before the new provider API shipped, we added the `_metamask.isEnabled` and `_metamask.isApproved` methods
to enable web3 sites to check if they have [access to the user's accounts](./rpc-api.html#eth-requestaccounts).
`isEnabled` and `isApproved` functioned identically, except that `isApproved` was `async`.
These methods were arguably never that useful, and they became completely redundant with the introduction of MetaMask's [permission system](./rpc-api.html#restricted-methods).

We recommend that you check for account access in the following ways:

1. You can call the [`wallet_getPermissions` RPC method](./rpc-api.html#wallet-getpermissions) and check for the `eth_accounts` permission.

2. You can call the `eth_accounts` RPC method and the [`ethereum._metamask.isUnlocked()` method](./ethereum-provider.html#ethereum-metamask-isunlocked).

   - MetaMask has to be unlocked before you can access the user's accounts.
     If the array returned by `eth_accounts` is empty, check if MetaMask is locked using `isUnlocked()`.

   - If MetaMask is unlocked and you still aren't receiving any accounts, it's time to request accounts using the [`eth_requestAccounts` RPC method](./rpc-api.html#eth-requestaccounts).

### Handling the Removal of `ethereum.publicConfigStore`

How to handle this change depends on if and how you relied on the `publicConfigStore`.
We have seen examples of listening for provider state changes the `publicConfigStore` `data` event, and accessing the `publicConfigStore` internal state directly.

We recommend that you search your code and its dependencies for references to `publicConfigStore`.
If you find any references, you should understand what it's being used for, and migrate to [one of the recommended provider APIs](./ethereum-provider.html#using-the-provider) instead.
If you don't find any references, you should not be affected by this change.

Although it is possible that your dependencies use the `publicConfigStore`, we have confirmed that the latest versions (as of January 2021) of the following common libraries were not affected by this change:

- `ethers`
- `web3` (web3.js)

### Handling the Removal of `ethereum.autoRefreshOnNetworkChange`

The `ethereum.autoRefreshOnNetworkChange` was a mutable boolean property used to control whether MetaMask reloaded the page on chain/network changes.
However, it only caused the page to be reloaded if the a script access a property on `window.web3`.
Therefore, this property was removed along with `window.web3`.

Despite this, we still recommend reloading the page on chain changes.
Some convenience libraries, such as [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers), will continue to reload the page by default.
If you don't use such a convenience library, you'll have to reload the page manually.
Please see the [`chainChanged` event](./ethereum-provider.html#chainchanged) for details.
