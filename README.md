# MetaMask developer documentation

This is the MetaMask developer documentation repository.
The documentation site is hosted at [`docs.metamask.io`](https://docs.metamask.io), and it's
built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator purpose-built for
technical documentation.

## Build locally

Build the documentation site locally using the following steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) version 3
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-docs.git
    cd metamask-docs
    ```

    > **Note:** If you don't have write access to this repository, you must [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) to your personal account and clone your forked repository instead. [Add an upstream remote](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#configuring-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-upstream-repository) to be able to pull from and push to the original repository.
    >
    > ```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/metamask-docs.git
    > cd metamask-docs
    > git remote add upstream https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-docs.git
    > ```
   
2. Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
   
3. Start the development server.

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
   
    Once the server starts, you can view the documentation at `http://localhost:3000`.
