## Why use the SDK?

MetaMask Wallet SDK gives your dapp a powerful upgrade:

- **Cross-platform, cross-browser support** - One integration covers both desktop and mobile, all major browsers, and the MetaMask mobile app—streamlining your user onboarding and eliminating edge cases.
- **Mobile connection that just works** - Say goodbye to clunky "open in in-app browser" flows.
  The SDK enables a native connection from any mobile browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.) directly to the MetaMask mobile app, using secure deeplinking and session management.
- **Production-ready, battle-tested** - MetaMask Wallet SDK is used in high-volume dapps across DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more—ensuring stability, speed, and a smooth developer experience.
- **Multichain by design** - Today, the SDK supports all EVM networks and Solana.
  Coming soon: Seamless connection to more ecosystems like Bitcoin and Tron.
  Futureproof your dapp with a single integration.
