# Use MetaMask SDK with Electron

Import [MetaMask SDK](../../../concepts/sdk/index.md) into your Electron dapp to enable your users
to easily connect to the MetaMask browser extension and MetaMask Mobile.

On the frontend, see the instructions to [use the SDK with React](react/index.md).
On the backend, see the instructions to [use the SDK with Node.js](nodejs.md).

## Example

See the [example Electron dapp](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk/tree/main/packages/examples/electronjs)
in the JavaScript SDK GitHub repository for more information.
