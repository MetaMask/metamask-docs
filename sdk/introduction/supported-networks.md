# Supported networks

## EVM networks

MetaMask SDK works with all EVM-compatible L1/L2 networks:

- Ethereum
- Linea
- Base
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- BNB Chain
- and [many more](https://chainlist.org/)

:::tip
For production deployments, it's important to use reliable RPC providers instead of public nodes. We recommend using services like [Infura](https://infura.io/) to ensure better reliability and performance.

## Non-EVM networks

Some non-EVM networks can work as well via [MetaMask Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/).

- Solana ([learn more here](https://solflare.com/metamask))
- StarkNet ([learn more here](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/use-non-evm-networks/starknet/))
