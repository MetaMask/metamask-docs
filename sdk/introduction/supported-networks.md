# Supported Networks

MetaMask SDK works with all EVM-compatible L1/L2 networks, including:

- Ethereum
- Linea
- Base
- Optimism
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Avalanche
- BNB Chain

See [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/) for the full list of supported networks.

:::tip
For production deployments, it's important to use reliable RPC providers instead of public nodes.
We recommend using services like [MetaMask Developer](https://developer.metamask.io/) to ensure better reliability and performance.

:::note
You can also connect to some non-EVM networks, including [Starknet](/wallet/how-to/use-non-evm-networks/starknet/), using MetaMask Snaps.
