#### `manageMFA()`

You can redirect users to the Embedded Wallets account dashboard to manage their MFA settings by calling the `manageMFA()` function. This method ensures that identity details are injected into the dashboard internally for custom verifier-based dapps. In order to see what's present on the account dashboard, please refer to the [Account Dashboard](/embedded-wallets/features/user-account-dashboard).

```javascript
await web3auth.manageMFA()
```

#### Interface

```typescript
manageMFA<T>(loginParams?: T): Promise<void>;
```

- **`loginParams` (optional):** Optional parameters to include during the MFA management process.
- **Returns:** A `Promise<void>` indicating successful redirection to the Account Dashboard.

:::tip

If MFA is not already enabled, the `manageMFA()` method will throw an error. Ensure you use `enableMFA()` before calling `manageMFA()`.

If your dapp uses default verifiers, users can directly log in to the account dashboard to manage MFA. For custom verifier-based dapps, the `manageMFA()` method must be used.
