#### `manageMFA()`

You can redirect users to the Web3Auth Account Dashboard to manage their MFA settings by calling the `manageMFA()` function. This method ensures that identity details are injected into the dashboard internally for custom verifier-based dApps. In order to see what's present on the account dashboard, please refer to the [Account Dashboard](/features/account-dashboard).

```javascript
await web3auth.manageMFA()
```

#### Interface

```typescript
manageMFA<T>(loginParams?: T): Promise<void>;
```

- **`loginParams`** (optional): Optional parameters to include during the MFA management process.
- **Returns**: A `Promise<void>` indicating successful redirection to the Account Dashboard.

:::tip

If MFA is not already enabled, the `manageMFA()` method will throw an error. Ensure you use `enableMFA()` before calling `manageMFA()`.

If your dApp uses default verifiers, users can directly log in to the Account Dashboard to manage MFA. For custom verifier-based dApps, the `manageMFA()` method must be used.
