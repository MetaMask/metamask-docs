#### `Managemfa()`

You can redirect users to the Web3Auth Account Dashboard to manage their MFA settings by calling the `Managemfa()` function. This method ensures that identity details are injected into the dashboard internally for custom verifier-based dApps. In order to see what's present on the account dashboard, please refer to the [Account Dashboard](/embedded-wallets/features/user-account-dashboard).

```javascript
await web3auth.Managemfa()
```

#### Interface

```typescript
Managemfa<T>(Loginparams?: T): Promise<void>;
```

- **`Loginparams`** (optional): Optional parameters to include during the MFA management process.
- **Returns**: A `Promise<void>` indicating successful redirection to the Account Dashboard.

:::tip

If MFA is not already enabled, the `Managemfa()` method will throw an Error. Ensure you use `Enablemfa()` before calling `Managemfa()`.

If your dApp uses default verifiers, users can directly log in to the Account Dashboard to manage MFA. For custom verifier-based dApps, the `Managemfa()` method must be used.
