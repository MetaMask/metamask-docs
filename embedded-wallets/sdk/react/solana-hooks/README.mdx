Embedded Wallets provides a set of React hooks for basic Solana wallet operations. These hooks are designed to simplify common Solana interactions in your React app.

:::info

For advanced Solana features, you should use [`@solana/web3.js`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) on top of the hooks provided.

## Solana hooks

| Hook Name            									         | Description               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [`useSignAndSendTransaction`](./useSignAndSendTransaction.mdx) | Sign and send a Solana transaction. |
| [`useSignMessage`](./useSignMessage.mdx)                       | Sign a message with the Solana wallet. |
| [`useSignTransaction`](./useSignTransaction.mdx)               | Sign a Solana transaction (without sending). |
| [`useSolanaWallet`](./useSolanaWallet.mdx)                     | Access Solana wallet state and utilities. |

Further code and advanced usage should be implemented using Solana's web3.js library as needed.
