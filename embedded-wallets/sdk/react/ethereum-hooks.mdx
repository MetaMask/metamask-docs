Web3Auth supports hooks based Ethereum wallet operations in React via [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/).
Once you have set up Wagmi using the Web3Auth Modal SDK, you can use all Wagmi hooks directly in
your application—no additional wrappers or configuration are needed beyond the initial setup.

## Wagmi Integration
