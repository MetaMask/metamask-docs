## Requirements

- iOS 14+
- Xcode 12+
- Swift 5.x

## Swift Package Manager

1. In Xcode, with your app project open, navigate to **File > Add Package Dependencies**.

2. When prompted, add the Web3Auth iOS SDK repository:

   ```sh
   https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk
   ```

   From the `Dependency Rule` dropdown, select `Exact Version` and enter `11.1.0` as the version.

3. When finished, Xcode will automatically begin resolving and downloading your dependencies in the background.

## Cocoapods

To install the Web3Auth SDK using Cocoapods, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Podfile, and add the Web3Auth pod:

```sh
pod 'Web3Auth', '~> 11.1.0'
```

2. Once added, use `pod install` command to download the Web3Auth dependency.

## Configure Redirection

To use Web3Auth for iOS you need to Whitelist your `bundleId` in your Web3Auth project.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), and create or open an existing Web3Auth project.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
