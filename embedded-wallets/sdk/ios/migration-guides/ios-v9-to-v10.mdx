This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v9 to v10 of the PnP iOS SDK. The
guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of Web3Auth OpenLogin
version v9, and Wallet Services v3.

## Breaking Changes

### `getSignResponse` is now removed.

In v10, we try to improve the developer experience by removing the `getSignResponse` method and
returning the result in the `request` method itself.

Previously, after calling the `request` method, developers had to use the `getSignResponse` method
to retrieve the `SignResponse`. In the latest version v10, the `request` method will return the
`SignResponse` directly.

```swift
// remove-next-line
try await self.web3Auth?.request(
// add-next-line
let response = try await self.web3Auth?.request(
    chainConfig: ChainConfig(
        chainId: "0x89",
        rpcTarget: "https://polygon.llamarpc.com"
    ),
    method: "personal_sign",
    requestParams: params
)


// remove-next-line
let response = try Web3Auth.getSignResponse()
if response!.success {
  print(response!.result!)
} else {
  print(response!.error!)
}

```

## Enhancements

In the latest version v10, we have added support for the Web3Auth Auth Service version v9, and
Wallet Services v3. In Wallet Services v3, the prebuilt wallet UI now supports the swap
functionality allowing users to swap to their favorite token from the app itself.
