Trigger logout flow. This function doesn't take parameters. A completable future containing a void object will be returned on successfull logout otherwise an Error response is returned.

:::tip

Additionally you can associate a function to be triggered on successful logout.

```cs
void Start()
{
    Web3auth = GetComponent<Web3Auth>();
    Web3auth.setOptions(new Web3AuthOptions()
    {

    });
    // Focus-next-line
    Web3auth.onLogout += onLogout;
}
//Focus-start
private void onLogout()
{
    // Functions to be called after user logs out
}
//Focus-end
```

:::

## Usage

```cs
public void logout()
{
    Web3auth.logout();
    Debug.Log("Logged out!");
}
```
