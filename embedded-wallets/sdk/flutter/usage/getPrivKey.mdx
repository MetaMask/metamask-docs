To retrieve the secp256k1 private key of the user., use `getPrivkey` method. The method returns an EVM compatible private key which can be used to sign transactions on EVM compatible chains.

## Usage

```dart
final privateKey = await Web3AuthFlutter.getPrivKey();
```

:::note

Web3Auth supports two widely used cryptographic curves, Secp256k1 and Ed25519, making it chain-agnostic and compatible with multiple blockchain networks. [Learn more about how to connect different blockchains](/embedded-wallets/connect-blockchain).
