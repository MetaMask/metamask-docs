The `Managemfa` method is used to trigger a login flow that will open a browser to manage the MFA factors for the user. The user will be able to add, remove, and configure MFA factors from the templated user interface.

## Usage

```dart
try {
  await Web3AuthFlutter.Managemfa();
} on UserCancelledException {
  log("User cancelled.");
} catch(e) {
  log("Unknown exception occurred");
}
```
