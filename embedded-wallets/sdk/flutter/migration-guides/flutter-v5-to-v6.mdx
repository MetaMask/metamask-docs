This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v5 to v6 of the PnP Flutter SDK. The
guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of Web3Auth OpenLogin
version v9, and Wallet Services v3.

## Breaking Changes

### `getSignResponse` is now removed.

In v6, we try to improve the developer experience by removing the `getSignResponse` method and
returning the result in the `request` method itself.

Previously, after calling the `request` method, developers had to use the `getSignResponse` method
to retrieve the `SignResponse`. In the latest version v6, the `request` method will return the
`SignResponse` directly.

```dart
try {
  List<dynamic> params = [];
  // Message to be signed
  params.add("Hello, Web3Auth from Flutter!");
  // User's EOA address
  params.add("<User Address in Hex>");

  // add-next-line
  final response = await Web3AuthFlutter.request(
    ChainConfig(
      chainId: "0x1",
      rpcTarget: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/$key",
    ),
    "personal_sign",
    params,
  );

  // remove-next-line
  final response = await Web3AuthFlutter.getSignResponse();

  log(response.toString());
} on UserCancelledException {
  log("User cancelled.");
} catch(e) {
  log("Unknown exception occurred");
}
```

## Minimum Android SDK Version

The minimum Android SDK version for the PnP Flutter SDK is now 26. Please update your app level
gradle file to set the minimum SDK version to 26.

```gradle
defaultConfig {
    // ...
    // add-next-line
    minSdkVersion 26 //flutter.minSdkVersion
    // remove-next-line
    minSdkVersion 24 //flutter.minSdkVersion
    // ...
}
```

## Enhancements

In the latest version v6, we have added support for the Web3Auth Auth Service version v9, and Wallet
Services v3. In Wallet Services v3, the prebuilt wallet UI now supports the swap functionality
allowing users to swap to their favorite token from the app itself.
