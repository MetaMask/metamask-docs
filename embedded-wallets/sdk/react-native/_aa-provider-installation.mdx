To use native account abstraction, you'll need to install the
[@web3auth/account-abstraction-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/account-abstraction-provider),
which allows you to create and interact with Smart contract Wallets (SCWs). This provider simplifies
the entire process by managing the complex logic behind configuring the account abstraction
provider, bundler, and preparing user operations.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/account-abstraction-provider
```
