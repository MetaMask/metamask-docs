Effortlessly create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a few lines of code, using
our Smart Account feature. Additionally, smart accounts offer enhanced control and programmability,
enabling features like those listed below.

- Gas Abstraction: Cover transaction fees for users, or allow users to pay for their own
  transactions using ERC-20 tokens.
- Batch Transactions: Perform multiple transactions in a single call.
- Automated Transactions: Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH hits
  $4,000.
- Set Spending Limits: Allow users to set tailored spending limits.

Our smart account integration streamlines your setup, allowing you to create and manage smart
accounts using your favorite libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Wagmi. With this, you don't need to
rely on third party packages to effortlessly create ERC-4337 compatible Smart Contract Wallets
(SCWs), and give users the ability to perform batch transactions and efficiently manage gas
sponsorship.

Web3Auth's smart account feature gives you the flexibility to configure your bundler client, and and
integrate your paymaster. For more insights into how ERC-4337 works and its components,
