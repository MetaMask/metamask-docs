## [`@web3auth/base-provider`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base-provider)

For connecting to blockchains other than EVM, Solana, and XRPL, you need to use the private key from Web3Auth and manually make RPC calls to the blockchain. This flow is facilitated by `@web3auth/base-provider` package.

In this section, we'll explore more about how you can use this provider with our SDKs.

## Installation

#### [`@web3auth/base-provider`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base-provider)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base-provider
```

## Initialisation

Import the `CommonPrivateKeyProvider` **class** from `@web3auth/base-provider`.

```javascript
import { CommonPrivateKeyProvider } from '@web3auth/base-provider'
```

### Assign the `CommonPrivateKeyProvider` class to a variable

After creating your Web3Auth instance, you need to initialize the CommonPrivateKeyProvider and add it to a class for further usage.

```javascript
const privateKeyProvider = new CommonPrivateKeyProvider()
```

:::info Note

- The common private key provider only exposes one RPC method (i.e. 'private_key') to get the private key of the logged-in user.

:::

## Chain Configuration

```typescript
const chainConfig = {
  chainNamespace: 'other',
  chainId: 'Algorand', //
  rpcTarget: 'https://api.algoexplorer.io',
  // Avoid using public rpcTarget in production.
  // Use services like PureStake, AlgoExplorer API, etc.
  displayName: 'Algorand Mainnet',
  blockExplorerUrl: 'https://algoexplorer.io',
  ticker: 'ALGO',
  tickerName: 'Algorand',
}
```

Post V10 release, Web3Auth PnP Web SDK does not need any additional setup on the code side for other chains. All is handled on the Dashboard.

```tsx
import { Web3Auth, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK } from '@web3auth/modal'

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
}
```

## Usage

On connection, you can use this `provider` as a private key provider to expose the user's private key in the frontend context

```tsx
//Assuming the user is already logged in.
async getPrivateKey() {
    const privateKey = await web3authSfaprovider.request({
        method: "private_key"
    });
    //Do something with privateKey
}
```
