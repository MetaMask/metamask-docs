The Web3Auth Smart Account feature is compatible with popular signer SDKs, including wagmi, ethers,
and viem. You can choose your preferred package to configure the signer.

You can retreive the Provider to configure the signer from Web3Auth instance.

:::info Wagmi

Wagmi does not require any special configuration to use the signer with smart Accounts. Once you
have set up your Web3Auth Provider and Connected your wallet, Wagmi's hooks (such as useSigner or
useAccount) will automatically use the smart account as the signer. You can interact with smart
Accounts using Wagmi just like you would with a regular EOA (Externally Owned Account) signer—no
additional setup is needed.
