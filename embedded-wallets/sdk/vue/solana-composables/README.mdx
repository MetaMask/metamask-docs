Web3Auth provides a set of Vue composables for basic Solana wallet operations. These composables are designed to simplify common Solana interactions in your Vue app.

For advanced Solana features, you should use [`@solana/web3.js`](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) on top of the composables provided.

| Composable Name             | Description                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `useSignAndSendTransaction` | Sign and send a Solana transaction.          |
| `useSignMessage`            | Sign a message with the Solana wallet.       |
| `useSignTransaction`        | Sign a Solana transaction (without sending). |
