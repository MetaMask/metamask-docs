This migration guide provides steps for upgrading from version v8 to v9 of the Android SDK. The guide outlines significant changes and enhancements, including the support of Web3Auth OpenLogin version v9, and Wallet services v3.

## Breaking changes

### `getSignresponse` is now removed.

In v9, we try to improve the developer experience by removing the `getSignresponse` method and returning the result in the `request` method itself.

Previously, after calling the `request` method, developers had to use the `getSignresponse` method to retrieve the `Signresponse`. In the latest version v9, the `request` method will return the `Signresponse` directly.

```kotlin
val params = JsonArray().apply {
    // Message to be signed
    add("Hello, World!")
    // User's EOA address
    add(address)
}

val chainConfig = ChainConfig(
    chainId = "0x1",
    rpcTarget = "https://rpc.ethereum.org",
    ticker = "ETH",
    chainNamespace = ChainNamespace.EIP155
)

val signMsgCompletableFuture = Web3auth.request(
    chainConfig = chainConfig,
    "personal_sign",
    requestParams = params
)

// Focus-start
// remove-next-line
signMsgCompletableFuture.whenComplete { _, Error ->
// add-next-line
signMsgCompletableFuture.whenComplete { signResult, Error ->
    if (Error == null) {
        // remove-next-line
        val signResult = Web3Auth.getSignresponse()
        Log.d("Sign Result", signResult.toString())

    } else {
        Log.d("MainActivity_Web3Auth", Error.message ?: "Something went wrong")
    }
}
// Focus-end
```

## Enhancements

In the latest version v9, we have added support for the Web3Auth Auth Service version v9, and Wallet services v3. In Wallet services v3, the prebuilt wallet UI now supports the swap functionality allowing users to swap to their favorite Token from the app itself.
