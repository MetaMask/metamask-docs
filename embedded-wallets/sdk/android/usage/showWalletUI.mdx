The `showWalletUI` method launches a WebView which allows you to use the templated wallet UI services. The method automatically uses the chain configuration from your project settings and no longer requires manual `ChainConfig` parameter.

### Supported Features

- **EVM Chains**: Full support for all EVM-compatible chains
- **Account Abstraction**: Built-in support for smart accounts (ERC-4337)
- **Gas Sponsorship**: Cover transaction fees for your users
- **Batch Transactions**: Execute multiple transactions in one go
- **Custom Spending Limits**: Set transaction limits for enhanced security

:::note

Access to Wallet Services is gated. You can use this feature in `sapphire_devnet` for free. The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this feature in a production environment is the **Scale Plan**.

:::warning

The chain configuration is now automatically retrieved from your project settings in the Web3Auth Dashboard. Make sure your project has the appropriate chains configured in the dashboard.

## Usage

```kotlin
// focus-start
val completableFuture = web3Auth.showWalletUI()
// focus-end
```

You can also specify a custom path:

```kotlin
// focus-start
val completableFuture = web3Auth.showWalletUI("custom-wallet-path")
// focus-end
```

## Smart Accounts Configuration

When smart accounts are enabled in your Web3Auth Dashboard, the wallet UI will automatically provide account abstraction features:

### Dashboard Configuration

1. Navigate to your project in the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io)
2. Enable Smart Accounts in your project settings
3. Configure your preferred bundler and paymaster providers

### Features Available

Once configured, users can:

- **Send Gasless Transactions**: Transactions can be sponsored by your paymaster
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple transactions can be bundled and executed as one
- **ERC-20 Token Payments**: Users can pay gas fees using ERC-20 tokens instead of native tokens
- **Automated Transaction Policies**: Set up rules for automatic transaction execution

### User Experience

When smart accounts are enabled:

1. Users will see a smart account address instead of an EOA address
2. Transaction confirmation screens will show sponsorship details
3. Batch transaction options will be available in the wallet UI
4. Gas payment options will include ERC-20 tokens if configured
