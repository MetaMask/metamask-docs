Once user has successfully logged in, you can retrieve the user's private key using the `getPrivKey` method from the Embedded Wallets Android SDK. We'll use this private key to generate the Credentials for the user.

This Credentials object has the user's keypair of private key and public key, and can be used to sign the transactions. Please note, that this assumes that the user has already logged in and the private key is available.

```kotlin
import org.web3j.crypto.Credentials

// Use your Embedded Wallets SDK instance to get the private key
val privateKey = web3Auth.getPrivKey()

// Generate the Credentials
val credentials = Credentials.create(privateKey)

// Get the address
val address = credentials.address
```
