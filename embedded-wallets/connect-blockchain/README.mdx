Web3Auth is the frontend authentication system for your dApp. Once the user is authenticated, the Web3Auth SDK returns a provider. A provider is how libraries like web3.js & ethers.js talk to the blockchain. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally done by submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket-based server. With Web3Auth, you get two types of providers, depending on the product you use:

1. [Shamir Secret Sharing based Private Key Providers](#for-web3auth-pnp-web-sdk)
2. [Threshold Signature Scheme based MPC Providers](#mpc-core-kit-providers)

## Web3Auth is Chain Agnostic

By default, Web3Auth supports the `secp256k1` and `ed25519` key curves. While these key curves serve the majority of blockchains out there, certain blockchains have different curve implementations of their own. While for MPC Core Kit, you need dedicated providers to interact with certain blockchains, with **Web3Auth PnP & SFA you can interact with any blockchain of your choice**.

In Web3Auth PnP & SFA, the ability to export the user's private key comes in handy. This private key can be utilized by the dApp to interact with the chain.

You can read more about this in our [Connect with Other Blockchains](./other/) section.

Web3Auth is composable - you can combine it with meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and other cryptographic protocols. It is easy to build on top of, and generally fits in with most other technology stacks, including but not limited to; your favorite scalability solutions, meta transactions, smart contract wallets, different elliptic curve pairs and even RSA.

## For Web3Auth PnP Web SDK

The Web3Auth PnP Web SDK(`@web3auth/modal`) from v10 onwards does not need any additional setup on the code side for blockchain connections. All of it is handled on the Dashboard. We can use any chain from the extensive list of predefined chains and add more if we need.

## MPC Core Kit Providers

The Threshold Signature Scheme-based MPC Providers work with our MPC Core Kit SDK. These providers generate a signature of the particular key curve the provider is configured for and accordingly gives you the interface to initialize with the blockchain it is configured for. Currently, Web3Auth MPC Core Kit supports the following providers:

- EIP1193 MPC Provider: For connecting with EVM-based chains
- EDDSA MPC Provider: For connecting with Solana and other chains that support the `ed25519` curve.
- Bitcoin MPC Provider

## Reference Guides for Blockchain Connections

You can check out the following guides we've written for certain blockchains. We have covered a wide variety of EVM and EVM Chains, supported by multiple web3auth providers.

## Adding JSON RPC APIs

Web3Auth providers give you a standard way of interacting with the blockchain. However, alongside that, it is recommended to use JSON RPC APIs, which help you connect to the blockchain without the need to run your own instance/ nodes. There are many services which offer a web API for accessing different blockchains:

#### Infura

[Infura](https://infura.io) is the leading platform for Ethereum infrastructure. It provides a gateway to the Ethereum network, allowing developers to build and scale decentralized applications without having to run their own infrastructure. Most of the Web3Auth backend infrastructure runs on Infura APIs.

## Faucets for Different Blockchains

Faucets are services that provide users with a small amount of cryptocurrency for free. These are often used for testing purposes or to onboard new users to a blockchain network. Here are some popular faucet services for different test blockchains:
