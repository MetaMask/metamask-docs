Since the web3dart package doesn't support deploying contracts directly, we'll use the precompiled smart
contract byteCode to deploy the contract using the `sendTransaction` method.

```dart
// Use the client, address, and credentials from previous code snippets

// Use the bytecode from the previous step
final payload = Uint8List.fromList(utf8.encode(byteCode));

final transaction = Transaction(
  // Please make sure to keep the `to` field as `null`
  // for deploying the contract
  to: null,
  from: address,
  data: payload,
);

final receipt = await client.sendTransaction(credential, transaction);
```
