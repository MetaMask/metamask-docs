We'll initialize the `Web3Client` with the RPC URL of the network you want to connect to. This
client allows us to interact with the blockchain. To get the public RPC URL, you can checkout
[chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/).

```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';

// Please avoid using public RPC URL in production, use services
// like Infura, Quicknode, etc.
final client = Web3Client("YOUR_RPC_URL", Client());
```
