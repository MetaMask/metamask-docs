To sign a transaction, you can use the `Web3Client` object we created earlier. It has
`signTransaction` method which signs the transaction for the given key pair, and chain.

The method internally handles the nonce, gas price, and gas limit. If you want to manually set the
nonce, gas price, and gas limit, you can override the parameters in the Transaction object.

```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';

// Use client, address, and credentials from previous code snippets
final signature = await client.signTransaction(
  credentials,
  Transaction(
    from: address,
    // Replace with the recipient address
    to: EthereumAddress.fromHex('0x809D4310d578649D8539e718030EE11e603Ee8f3'),
    // Replace with the amount of ETH to send
    value: EtherAmount.fromUnitAndValue(EtherUnit.gwei, 50000000), // 0.05 ETH
    chainId: null,
    fetchChainIdFromNetworkId: true,
  ),
);
```
