To retrieve the native balance of the user, you can use the `Web3Client` object we created earlier.
It has `getBalance` method which helps to fetch the user's native token balance.

The result we get from Web3Client is in wei, the smallest value. To convert the value to ether, you
can divide it with 10^18, where 18 denotes the decimals for wei.

For the simplicity, we'll use a helper function from web3dart package which has the same
implementation

```dart

// Use the client and address variable from above
final balanceResponse = await client.getBalance(address);

// Convert the balance to ether format, and round off to 4 decimal places.
final balance = balanceResponse.getValueInUnit(EtherUnit.ether).toStringAsFixed(4);
```
