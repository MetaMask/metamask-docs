Once user has successfully logged in, you can retrieve the user's private key using the `getPrivKey`
method from Web3AuthFlutter. We'll use this private key to generate the Credentials for the user.

This Credentials object has the user's key pair of private key and public key, and can be used to
sign the transactions. Please note, that this assumes that the user has already logged in and the
private key is available.

```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';

final privateKey = await Web3AuthFlutter.getPrivKey();

final credentials = EthPrivateKey.fromHex(privateKey);
final address = credentials.address;
```
