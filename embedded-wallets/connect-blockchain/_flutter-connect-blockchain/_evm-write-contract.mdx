Similary, you can write to the contract using the `sendTransaction` method supported by Web3Client. In this
sample, we'll update the message in the contract we deployed previously.

```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';
// Use the client, address, contractAbi and credentials from previous code snippets
final contract = DeployedContract(
    ContractAbi.fromJson(contractAbi, ''),
    "ADDRESS_OF_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_IN_HEX",
);

final updateFunction = contract.function('update');
final receipt = await client.sendTransaction(
  credentials,
  Transaction.callContract(
    contract: contract,
    function: updateFunction,
    parameters: ["YOUR_NEW_MESSAGE"]
  )
);
```
