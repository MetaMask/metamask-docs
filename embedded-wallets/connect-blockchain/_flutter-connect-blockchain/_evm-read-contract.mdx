To interact with any smart contract, you need the contract address and the ABI of the contract. The
ABI of the contract helps encode the function name and its parameters. Considering ABI as a outline
of the contract, which provides contract specifications.

We'll create a `DeployedContract` instance with the contract address and ABI. Once created, we can
use it to call the contract function. To interact with the contract, we'll use the `call` method
form the Web3Client.

In this sample, we'll read the message from the contract we deployed in the previous step.

```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';

// Use the client, address, contractAbi and credentials from previous code snippets
final contract = DeployedContract(
    ContractAbi.fromJson(contractAbi, ''),
    "ADDRESS_OF_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_IN_HEX",
);

final messageFunction = contract.function('message');

final message = await client.call(
    contract: contract,
    function: messageFunction,
    params: [],
);
```
