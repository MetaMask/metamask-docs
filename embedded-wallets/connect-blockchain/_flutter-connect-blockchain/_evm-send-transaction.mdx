If you wish to sign, and also broadcast the transaction, you can use the
`Web3Client.sendTransaction` method.

This method prepares the transaction, and signs similar to `signTransaction` method. The only
difference is, it also broadcasts the transaction to the network, and returns the transaction
receipt.

```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';

// Use client, address, and credentials from previous code snippets
final receipt = await client.sendTransaction(
  credentials,
  Transaction(
    from: address,
    to: EthereumAddress.fromHex('0x809D4310d578649D8539e718030EE11e603Ee8f3'),
    value: EtherAmount.fromUnitAndValue(EtherUnit.gwei, 50000000), // 0.05 ETH
    chainId: null,
    fetchChainIdFromNetworkId: true,
  ),
);
```
