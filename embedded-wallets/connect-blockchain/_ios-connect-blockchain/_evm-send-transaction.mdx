For signing and sending the transaction, we'll create helper methods to get the nonce, gas price,
estimate the gas and send the transaction: 

- nonce is the number of transactions sent from the sender's address
- gas price is the unit of account for the transaction
- gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that the sender is willing to pay for the transaction

The gas values are in ether. We'll also create a helper method to convert the amount to wei.

Once the transaction object is created, we'll estimate the gas and create a new transaction object
with the gas limit. Finally, we'll send the transaction using
`EthereumHttpClient.eth_sendRawTransaction` method and get the hash.

```swift
import web3

private let etherInWei = pow(Double(10), 18)

private func getNonce() async throws -> Int {
    let nonce = try await client.eth_getTransactionCount(address: account.address, block: .Latest)
    return nonce
}

private func getGasPrice() async throws -> BigUInt {
    return try await client.eth_gasPrice()
}

private func estimateGas(ethereumTransaction: EthereumTransaction) async throws -> BigUInt {
    return try await client.eth_estimateGas(ethereumTransaction)
}

public func toWei(ether: Ether) -> Wei {
    let wei = Wei(ether * etherInWei)
    return wei
}

let nonce = try await getNonce()
let gasPrice = try await getGasPrice()

// Convert the amount to Wei
let value = toWei(ether: Ether(floatLiteral: 0.001))

let ethereumTransaction = EthereumTransaction(
    // Use the account from previous step
    from: account.address,
    to: EthereumAddress.init(stringLiteral: "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_IN_HEX_FORMAT"),
    value: value,
    // Empty data, 0x
    data: Data(),
    nonce: nonce,
    gasPrice: gasPrice,
    gasLimit: nil,
    // Use the chain id from previous step
    chainId: CHAIN_ID_IN_INTEGER
)

// Estimate the gas
let gasLimit = try await estimateGas(ethereumTransaction: ethereumTransaction)

let transaction = EthereumTransaction(
    // Use the account from previous step
    from: account.address,
    to: EthereumAddress.init(stringLiteral: "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_IN_HEX_FORMAT"),
    value: value,
    // Empty data, 0x
    data: Data(),
    nonce: nonce,
    gasPrice: gasPrice,
    gasLimit: gasLimit,
    // Use the chain id from previous step
    chainId: CHAIN_ID_IN_INTEGER
)

// Use the account from previous step
let hash = try await client.eth_sendRawTransaction(transaction, withAccount: account)
```
