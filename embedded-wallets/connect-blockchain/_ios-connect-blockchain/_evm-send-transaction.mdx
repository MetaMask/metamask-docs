For signing and sending the transaction, we'll create helper methods to get the nonce, gas price,
estimate the gas and send the transaction. The nonce is the number of transactions sent from the
address. The gas price is the price of the gas in Wei. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas
that can be used to send the transaction. Apart form that, we'll also create a helper method to
convert the amount to Wei.

Once the transaction object is created, we'll estimate the gas and create a new transaction object
with the gas limit. Finally, we'll send the transaction using
`EthereumHttpClient.eth_sendRawTransaction` method and get the hash.

```swift
import web3

private let etherInWei = pow(Double(10), 18)

private func getNonce() async throws -> Int {
    let nonce = try await client.eth_getTransactionCount(address: account.address, block: .Latest)
    return nonce
}

private func getGasPrice() async throws -> BigUInt {
    return try await client.eth_gasPrice()
}

private func estimateGas(ethereumTransaction: EthereumTransaction) async throws -> BigUInt {
    return try await client.eth_estimateGas(ethereumTransaction)
}

public func toWei(ether: Ether) -> Wei {
    let wei = Wei(ether * etherInWei)
    return wei
}

let nonce = try await getNonce()
let gasPrice = try await getGasPrice()

// Convert the amount to Wei
let value = toWei(ether: Ether(floatLiteral: 0.001))

let ethereumTransaction = EthereumTransaction(
    // Use the account from previous step
    from: account.address,
    to: EthereumAddress.init(stringLiteral: "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_IN_HEX_FORMAT"),
    value: value,
    // Empty data, 0x
    data: Data(),
    nonce: nonce,
    gasPrice: gasPrice,
    gasLimit: nil,
    // Use the chain id from previous step
    chainId: CHAIN_ID_IN_INTEGER
)

// Estimate the gas
let gasLimit = try await estimateGas(ethereumTransaction: ethereumTransaction)

let transaction = EthereumTransaction(
    // Use the account from previous step
    from: account.address,
    to: EthereumAddress.init(stringLiteral: "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_IN_HEX_FORMAT"),
    value: value,
    // Empty data, 0x
    data: Data(),
    nonce: nonce,
    gasPrice: gasPrice,
    gasLimit: gasLimit,
    // Use the chain id from previous step
    chainId: CHAIN_ID_IN_INTEGER
)

// Use the account from previous step
let hash = try await client.eth_sendRawTransaction(transaction, withAccount: account)
```
