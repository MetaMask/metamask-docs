To retrieve the user's Ethereum address, you can use the `EthereumAccount` class. This account can
also be used to sign transactions and messages.

The package doesn't provides any direct way to consume the the private key and create an account.
Hence, we'll create an extension for the `Web3AuthState` extending the
`EthereumSingleKeyStorageProtocol` to retrieve the private key and create an account.

```swift
import web3
import Web3Auth

extension Web3AuthState: EthereumSingleKeyStorageProtocol {
    public func storePrivateKey(key: Data) throws {

    }

    public func loadPrivateKey() throws -> Data {
        guard let data = self.privKey?.web3.hexData else {
            throw PlaygroundError.decodingError
        }

        return data
    }
}
```

Once we have created the extension, we can use the Web3AuthState to create an EthereumAccount.
Please note, that this assumes that the user has already logged in and the state is available.

```swift
import web3

// Use your existing Web3Auth instance
let web3authState = web3Auth.state!

let account = try EthereumAccount(keyStorage: web3authState)
let address = account.address
```
