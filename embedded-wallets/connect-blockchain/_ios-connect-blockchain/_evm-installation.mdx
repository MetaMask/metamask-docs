To interact with the Ethereum compatible blockchains in Swift, you can use any
[`EIP1193`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) compatible package. Here, we're using
[web3swift](https://github.com/argentlabs/web3.swift) to demonstrate how to make blockchain calls
using it with Web3Auth.

To install the `web3swift` package, you have two options. You can either use Swift Package Manager
or CocoaPods.

<Tabs defaultValue = "spm"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift Package Manager", value: "spm", },
    { label: "CocoaPods", value: "cocoapods", },
  ]}

<TabItem value="spm">

1. In Xcode, with your app project open, navigate to **File > Add Packages**.

1. When prompted, add the single-factor-auth-swift iOS SDK repository:

   ```sh
   https://github.com/argentlabs/web3.swift
   ```

1. When finished, Xcode will automatically begin resolving and downloading your dependencies in the
   background.

To install the Web3Auth SingleFactorAuth SDK using Cocoapods, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Podfile, and add the SingleFactorAuth pod:

   ```sh
   pod 'web3.swift'
   ```

2. Once added, use `pod install` command to download the dependency.
