Initialize the `EthereumHttpClient` with the RPC URL and chain id
of the network you want to connect to, to interact with the blockchain. To get the public RPC URL, and other details as chain id, see [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/).

```swift
import web3

let client = EthereumHttpClient(
    // Please avoid using public RPC URL in production, use services
    // like Infura.
    url: URL.init(string: rpcUrl)!,
    // Replace with the chain id of the network you want to connect to
    network: .custom(chainId)
)
```
