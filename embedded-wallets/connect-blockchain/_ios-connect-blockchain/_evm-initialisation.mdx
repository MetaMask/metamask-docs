To interact with the blockchain, initialize the `EthereumHttpClient` with the RPC URL, and chain id
of the network you want to connect to. To get the public RPC URL, and other details as chain id, you
can checkout [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/).

```swift
import web3

let client = EthereumHttpClient(
    // Please avoid using public RPC URL in production, use services
    // like Infura, Quicknode, etc.
    url: URL.init(string: rpcUrl)!,
    // Replace with the chain id of the network you want to connect to
    network: .custom(chainId)
)
```
