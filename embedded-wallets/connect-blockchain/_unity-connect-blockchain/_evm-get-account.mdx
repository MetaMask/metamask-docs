In this reference, we're using the `Nethereum` library to demonstrate how to make blockchain calls
using it with Web3Auth.

# Package installation instructions ([Official repository](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.Unity))

Install via **Package Manager** using OpenUpm

- open Edit/Project Settings/Package Manager

- add a new **Scoped Registry** (or edit the existing OpenUPM entry)

  - Name package.openupm.com

  - URL https://package.openupm.com

  - Scope(s) com.nethereum.unity

- click Save or Apply

- Open **Window/Package Manager**

- click **+**

- select Add package by name... or Add package from git URL...

- paste **com.nethereum.unity** into name

- paste **4.19.2** into version (or your preferred one)

- click **Add**

# Installing package for old version

- Download the latest `net461dllsAOT.zip` package from Nethereum's
  [latest release](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum/releases)

- Extract and the rename the folder to `NethereumLib` for easy identification.

- Move the folder to the `Assets/Plugins` folder of your Unity project.

- You might have to delete a few files from the `NethereumLib` fold er, if you're getting any errors
  while building the project. For our implementation, we deleted the following files:
  `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`, all the files starting with `System.*`, `UnityEngine.dll`,
  `Nethereum.Web3Lite.dll`, `Nethereum.HdWallet.dll`, `NBitcoin.dll`, `Nethereum.RPC.Reactive.dll`
  and `Common.Logging.Core.dll`.

:::info

We have followed [this guide](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/unity3d-introduction/) to set up
the `Nethereum` package in our app. You can check their sample applications as well for a decent
reference.

You can also check the
[Web3Auth Unity Sample Apps](/examples?product=Plug+and+Play&sdk=Plug+and+Play+Unity+SDK), where we
have added the required packages.
