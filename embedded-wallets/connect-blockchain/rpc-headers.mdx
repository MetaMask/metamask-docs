### Adding API Keys in RPC Headers

Web3Auth allows you to specify the RPC endpoint URL, but it doesn't directly provide an option to
set custom HTTP headers such as API keys required by certain blockchain providers. To accommodate
blockchain APIs that require authentication headers, you need to manually intercept and attach these
headers to your application's outgoing RPC requests.

We'll use **TRON** as an example in this guide. You can obtain your TRON API key
[here](https://developers.tron.network/reference/select-network).

:::tip

If you're using TRON's mainnet RPC endpoint (`https://api.trongrid.io`), you may face rate limits or
rejected requests unless you attach the required `TRON-PRO-API-KEY` header. This guide helps you
configure that. However, if you're working on the Shasta testnet (`https://api.shasta.trongrid.io`),
this step is not required.

:::

### Identifying RPC Host URL

First, identify the hostname for your RPC provider by checking the network logs in your browser:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (`Network` tab).
2. Execute a blockchain-related action (e.g., fetching balance).
3. Locate the RPC request URL (e.g., `https://api.trongrid.io/jsonrpc`).
4. Note the hostname (e.g., `api.trongrid.io`).

### Adding Headers via Global `fetch` Patch

Create a file named `globals.js` and include the following code snippet:

```jsx title="globals.js"
(function () {
  if (typeof globalThis === "undefined") {
    if (typeof global !== "undefined") global.globalThis = global;
    else if (typeof self !== "undefined") self.globalThis = self;
    else if (typeof window !== "undefined") window.globalThis = window;
    else throw new Error("Unable to locate global object");
  }
})();

const { fetch: originalFetch } = globalThis;

const RPC_HEADER_MAP = {
  "api.trongrid.io": {
    "TRON-PRO-API-KEY": "YOUR_TRON_API_KEY",
  },
  // Add other RPC hosts and headers if needed
};

globalThis.fetch = (...args) => {
  const [resource, config = {}] = args;
  const url = new URL(resource instanceof Request ? resource.url : resource);
  const headers = new Headers(config.headers || {});

  const customHeaders = RPC_HEADER_MAP[url.hostname];

  if (customHeaders) {
    Object.entries(customHeaders).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      headers.set(key, value);
    });
  }

  return originalFetch(resource, { ...config, headers });
};
```

Replace `"YOUR_TRON_API_KEY"` with the actual API key provided by your blockchain RPC provider.

### Importing the Patch into Your Application

Make sure to import this file at the very beginning of your application's entry point (`index.tsx`
or `main.ts`):

```tsx
import "./globals"; // Ensure this is the first import
```

:::warning Note

Perform this operation with caution. Avoid exposing sensitive API keys within client-side
applications. Ensure the API keys used here are restricted and suitable for public-facing
environments.

:::

### Why This Approach Works

- Web3Auth SDK uses the provided RPC URL configured via the developer dashboard.
- Blockchain SDKs like `TronWeb` internally use the global `fetch` API.
- Our patch intercepts these fetch calls and injects necessary headers, ensuring compatibility with
  authenticated blockchain RPCs.

:::tip

**Security Recommendations:**

- Always use restricted or public-safe API keys in frontend environments.
- Enable key restrictions or usage limits wherever possible.
- For sensitive transactions, consider routing through a secure backend server.
