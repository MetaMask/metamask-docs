Post V10 release, Web3Auth Web SDK does not need any additional setup on the code side for other
chains. All is handled on the Dashboard.

```tsx
import { Web3Auth, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/modal";

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
};
```
