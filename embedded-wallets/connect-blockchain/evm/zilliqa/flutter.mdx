While using the Embedded Wallets Flutter SDK, you get the private key within the user scope after successful authorization. This private key can be used to retrieve the user's address, and interact with [Zilliqa 2.0](https://www.zilliqa.com/) to make any blockchain calls. We have highlighted a few here for getting you started quickly on that.
