Web3Auth's SDKs are fully compatible with all EVM-based chains, following the specifications outlined in EIP155 and EIP 1193. EIP 155 defines the standard for transaction replay protection, enhancing security measures for authenticating users across various platforms. EIP 1193, on the other hand, outlines the standard EVM API, enabling developers to interact with EVM blockchains efficiently.

:::note

With Web3Auth PnP V10 onwards, the chains are already added to the Dashboard. We can use any chain from the extensive list of predefined chains and add more if we need by toggling them on. See our guide to [add custom chains](/connect-blockchain/custom-chains) for more details.
