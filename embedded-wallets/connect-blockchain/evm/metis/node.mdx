While using the Web3Auth Node SDK, you get a Ethers Signer on successful authentication. This signer can be used with libraries like [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/) etc. to make [Metis](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain calls like getting the user's `account`, fetching `balance`, `sign transaction`, `send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc. We have highlighted a few here to get you started quickly on that.
