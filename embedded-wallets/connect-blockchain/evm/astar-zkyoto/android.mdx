While using the Embedded Wallets Mobile SDKs (formerly Web3Auth) on Android, the private key is available in the SDK state after successful authorization. Use it to derive the user's address and interact with the [Astar zKyoto](https://docs.astar.network/docs/build/zkEVM/quickstart) testnet for signing and JSON-RPC calls.

::::note

The SDKs are now branded as MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDKs (formerly Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs). Package names and APIs remain Web3Auth (for example, Web3Auth React SDK), and code snippets may reference `web3auth` identifiers.
