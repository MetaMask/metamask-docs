While using the Web3Auth Unity SDK, you get the private key within the user scope. This private key can interact with the [Nethereum Library](https://nethereum.com/) to make EVM based blockchain calls, like getting user's `account`, fetch `balance`, `sign transaction`, `send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc. We have highlighted a few here for getting you started quickly on that.
