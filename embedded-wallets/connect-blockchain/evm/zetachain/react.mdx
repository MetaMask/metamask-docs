While using the Web3Auth React SDK, you get access to the Web3Auth Hooks. You can pair it up with the Wagmi hooks to make EVM based blockchain calls, like getting user's `account`, fetch `balance`, `sign transaction`, `send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc. We have highlighted a few here for getting you started quickly on that.
