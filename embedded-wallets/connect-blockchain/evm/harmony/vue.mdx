While using the Web3Auth Vue SDK, you get access to the Web3Auth Composables. You can pair it up with the Wagmi composables to make EVM based blockchain calls, like getting user's `account`, fetch `balance`, `sign transaction`, `send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc. We have highlighted a few here for getting you started quickly on that.
