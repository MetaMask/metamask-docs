While using the Web3Auth React Native SDK, you get a [`EIP1193`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) provider, similar to the [MetaMask Provider](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html). This provider can be used with libraries like [`web3.js`](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.8/getting-started.html), [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/getting-started/) etc. to make [Moonbeam](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain calls like getting the user's `account`, fetching `balance`, `sign transaction`, `send transaction`, `read` from and `write` to the smart contract, etc. We have highlighted a few here to get you started.
