Integrate Web3Auth seamlessly with EVM-based Tron Blockchain. For Web SDKs, Web3Auth returns a provider that can be directly used to initialize the libraries like ethers.js, web3.js etc. and make blockchain calls, while for Mobile & Gaming SDKs, the private key is available in the user scope which can be used in a similar way to initialize the respective blockchain interaction libraries and make calls to the network.

This documentation provides a straightforward guide for developers looking to implement blockchain connections quickly and effortlessly across various platforms.
