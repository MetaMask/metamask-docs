While using the Web3Auth iOS SDK, you can retrive the Ed25519 private key upon successful
authentication. This private key can be used to derive user's public address and interact with
[Solana](https://solana.org/) chain. We have highlighted a few methods here for getting you started
quickly on that.

## Installation

To interact with the Solana blockchain in iOS, you can use any Solana compatible SDK. Here, we're
using [SolanaSwift](https://github.com/p2p-org/solana-swift) to demonstrate how to interact with
Solana chain using Web3Auth.

<Tabs defaultValue = "spm"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift Package Manager", value: "spm", },
    { label: "CocoaPods", value: "cocoapods", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="spm">

To install `SolanaSwift` through Swift Package Manager, follow the below steps:

1. Open your project in Xcode, navigate to **File > Add Package Dependencies**.

2. When prompted, add the SolanaSwift SDK repository:

   ```sh
    https://github.com/p2p-org/solana-swift
   ```

   From the `Dependency Rule` dropdown, select `Exact Version` and enter `5.0.0` as the version.

Once finished, Xcode will automatically begin resolving and downloading your dependencies in the
background.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cocoapods">

To install using CocoaPods, simply add the following line to your Podfile

```
pod 'SolanaSwift', '~> 5.0.0'
```

Once you have added SolanaSwift to Podfile, run the following command:

```bash
pod install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize

To Initialize the `JSONRPCAPIClient` we require rpc url. The `JSONRPCAPIClient` instance will
provide a gateway & protocol to interact with Solana cluster while sending requests and receving
response. For this example, we are using rpc url for Devnet-beta. To interact with Testnet or
Mainnet, you can simply change the rpc url.

### Initializing Solana SDK

In the below code block, we'll create the `JSONRPCAPIClient` instance using the Devnet-beta rpc.

```swift
import SolanaSwift

let endpoint = APIEndPoint(
    address: "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
    network: .devnet
)

// focus-next-line
let solanaJSONRPCClient = JSONRPCAPIClient(endpoint: endpoint)
```

### Initializing Web3Auth SDK

In the below code block, we'll initialize the Web3Auth SDK and check whether the user has any
Web3Auth session persisted or not. If the user is already authenticated, you can route them directly
to home view, otherwise you can route them to login view for authentication purpose. For checking,
if user is already authenticated, we can check whether `Web3Auth.state` is `nil` or not.

By default, the session is persisted for 1 day. You can modify it using `sessionTime` parameter
during initialization.

> Note: Note: The session can be persisted only for 30 days max

```swift
import Web3Auth

// Initialize Web3Auth SDK
// focus-start
let web3Auth = await Web3Auth(
    W3AInitParams(
        clientId: "BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X3oVAbCiAZOTEBtTXw4tsluTITPqA8zMsfxIKMjiqNQ",
        network: Network.sapphire_mainnet,
        redirectUrl: "com.w3a.ios-solana-example"
    )
)
// focus-end

// Check whether state is nil or not for user authentication status.
let isUserAuthenticated = web3Auth.state != nil

// Customize your logic to perform operations or navigation
```

## Get User Info

After logging in, the Web3Auth instance will provide you with information regarding the user that is
logged in. This information is obtained directly from the JWT token and is not stored by Web3Auth.
Therefore, this information can only be accessed through social logins after the user has logged
into your application. You can get the user information using `getUserInfo` function. The function
will throw error in case if user is not authenticated.

```swift
let userInfo: Web3AuthUserInfo = try web3Auth.getUserInfo()
```

## Get Account

We can use `getEd25519PrivKey` method in Web3Auth to retrive the priavte key for the Solana
ecosystem. In the below code block, we'll use the Ed25519 private key to retive user's public
address by creating `KeyPair`. The `KeyPair` struct from `SolanaSwift` SDK once created can be used
to sign the Solana transactions.

```swift
let ed25519PrivateKey = web3Auth.getEd25519PrivKey()
let keyPair = try KeyPair(secretKey: Data(hex: ed25519PrivateKey))

// focus-next-line
let userAccount = keyPair.publicKey.base58EncodedString
```

## Get User balance

Once we have retrived userAccount, we can use it to fetch user balance. We'll use `getBalance`
method from `JSONRPCAPIClient` instance to interact with Solana cluster and fetch user balance. The
response of `getBalance` is UInt64, we will need to divide it by by 10^9, because Solana's token
decimals is 9. To help us with the calculation, the SDK also provides a `convertToBalance` function.

```swift
// focus-start
let balanceResponse = try await solanaJSONRPCClient.getBalance(
     // Use userAccount from above
    account: userAccount
)
// focus-end

// We are dividing the balance by 10^9, because Solana's
// token decimals is set to be 9;
let userBalance = return balanceResponse.convertToBalance(decimals: 9)
```

## Sign Transaction

Let's now go through how can we sign the transaction. In the below codeblock, we'll create a new
function `perpareTransaction` which can be used to retrive the Base58 signature as well as broadcast
transaction to the cluster. We'll use `BlockchainClient.prepareSendingNativeSOL` to create the
transaction to self transfer 0.01 Sol and sign it. You can also checkout `prepareSendingSPLTokens`,
and `prepareTransaction` for other types of transaction.

```swift
let blockchainClient = BlockchainClient(apiClient: solanaJSONRPCClient)

 private func perpareTransaction() async throws -> PreparedTransaction {
    let transaction = try await blockchainClient.prepareSendingNativeSOL(
        from: keyPair,
        to: "2idRaWFin4Zn5WY9or6XBhcoF6cyfDWSbJQ26jAtptxD",
        amount: 0.01.toLamport(decimals: 9)
    )

    return transaction
}
```

Once we have created `perpareTransaction` function, we'll use it to prepare, sign the transaction,
and retrive Base58 signature. You can use `findSignature` to retrive the signature for the
respective signer.

```swift
do {
    var transaction = try await perpareTransaction()
    try transaction.sign()
    let signature = try transaction.findSignature(publicKey: keyPair.publicKey)

    // Perform your action
} catch let error {
    // Perform error handling
}
```

## Send Transaction

For the send transaction, we'll use `sendTransaction` method from `BlockchainClient` instance to
broadcast the result of `perpareTransaction` to the cluster.

```swift
do {
    let transaction = try await perpareTransaction()
    let hash = try await blockchainClient.sendTransaction(preparedTransaction: transaction)

    // Perform your action
} catch let error {
    // Perform error handling
}
```
