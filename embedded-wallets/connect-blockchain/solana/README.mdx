For Solana integration, Embedded Wallets (formerly Web3Auth) offers an `ed25519` private key specifically tailored for the Solana blockchain. This cryptographic key conforms to the standards required for secure authentication and transaction signing on Solana's network.

Integrating Embedded Wallets with Solana is straightforward and efficient. Developers can leverage the SDK to establish secure connections with Solana nodes, enabling seamless interaction with the blockchain. This includes tasks such as submitting transactions, querying blockchain data, and managing user authentication within Solana-based applications.

With native support for Solana and the `ed25519` curve, you can streamline development and harness the full potential of blockchain technology within Solana-based projects.

::::note

The SDKs are now branded as MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDKs (formerly Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs). Package names and APIs remain Web3Auth (for example, Web3Auth React SDK), and code snippets may reference `web3auth` identifiers.

This documentation provides a straightforward guide for developers looking to implement Solana connection quickly and effortlessly across various platforms.
