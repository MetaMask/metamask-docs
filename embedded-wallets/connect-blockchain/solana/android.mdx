While using the Web3Auth Android SDK, you can retrive the Ed25519 private key upon successful
authentication. This private key can be used to derive user's public address and interact with
[Solana](https://solana.org/) chain. We have highlighted a few methods here for getting you started
quickly on that.

## Installation

To interact with the Solana blockchain in Android, you can use any Solana compatible SDK. Here,
we're using [sol4k](https://github.com/sol4k/sol4k) to demonstrate how to interact with Solana chain
using Web3Auth.

In your app-level gradle's dependencies section, add the following:

<Tabs defaultValue = "groovy"
  values={[
    { label: "Groovy", value: "groovy", },
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin", },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="groovy">

```groovy
dependencies {
     implementation 'org.sol4k:sol4k:0.4.1'
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
dependencies {
   implementation("org.sol4k:sol4k:0.4.1")
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Initialize

To Initialize the `Connection` we require rpc url. The `Connection` object will provide a gateway &
protocol to interact with Solana cluster while sending requests and receving response.The `sol4k`
SDK also provides `RpcUrl` constant for all the supported clusters. For this example, we are using
`RpcUrl.DEVNET` for Devnet-beta. To interact with Testnet or Mainnet, you can simply change the
`RpcUrl`.

### Initializing Solana SDK

In the below code block, we'll create the `Connection` instance using the Devnet-beta rpc.

```kotlin
import org.sol4k.Connection
import org.sol4k.RpcUrl

val connection = Connection(RpcUrl.DEVNET)
```

### Initializing Web3Auth SDK

In the below code block, we'll initialize the Web3Auth SDK and check whether the user has any
Web3Auth session persisted or not. If the user is already authenticated, you can route them directly
to `HomeScreen`, otherwise you can route them to `LoginScreen` for authentication purpose. For
checking, if user is already authenticated, we can check whether private key is empty or not.

By default, the session is persisted for 1 day. You can modify it using `sessionTime` parameter
during initialization.

> Note: Note: The session can be persisted only for 30 days max

```kotlin
import com.web3auth.core.Web3Auth
import com.web3auth.core.types.Network
import com.web3auth.core.types.Web3AuthOptions

// Initialize Web3Auth SDK
// focus-start
val web3Auth: Web3Auth = Web3Auth(
    Web3AuthOptions(
        clientId = "BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X3oVAbCiAZOTEBtTXw4tsluTITPqA8zMsfxIKMjiqNQ",
        context = context,
        network = Network.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
        redirectUrl = Uri.parse( "com.example.androidsolanaexample://auth")
    )
)
// focus-end

// Check whether private key is empty or not for user authentication status.
val isUserAuthenticated = web3Auth.getPrivkey().isNotEmpty()

// Customize your logic to perform operations or navigation
```

## Get User Info

After logging in, the Web3Auth instance will provide you with information regarding the user that is
logged in. This information is obtained directly from the JWT token and is not stored by Web3Auth.
Therefore, this information can only be accessed through social logins after the user has logged
into your application. You can get the user information using `getUserInfo` function. The function
will throw error in case if user is not authenticated.

```kotlin
try {
    // focus-next-line
    val userInfo = web3Auth.getUserInfo()!!
} catch(e: Exception) {
    // Perform suitable error handling
}
```

## Get Account

We can use `getEd25519PrivKey` method in Web3Auth to retrive the priavte key for the Solana
ecosystem. In the below code block, we'll use the Ed25519 private key to retive user's public
address by creating `Keypair`. The `Keypair` instance from `sol4k` SDK once created can be used to
sign the Solana transactions.

```kotlin
val ed25519PrivateKey = web3Auth.getEd25519PrivKey()
val solanaKeyPair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(ed25519PrivateKey.hexToByteArray())

// focus-next-line
val userAccount = solanaKeyPair.publicKey.toBase58()
```

## Get User balance

Once we have retrived userAccount, we can use it to fetch user balance. We'll use `getBalance`
method from `Connection` instance to interact with Solana cluster and fetch user balance. The
response of `getBalance` is BigInteger, we will need to divide it by by 10^9, because Solana's token
decimals is 9.

```kotlin
try {
    // Use solanaPrivateKey from above
    val publicKey = solanaPrivateKey.publicKey;

    // focus-next-line
    val balanceResponse = connection.getBalance(publicKey).toBigDecimal()

    // We are dividing the balance by 10^9, because Solana's
    // token decimals is set to be 9;
    val userBalance = balanceResponse.divide(BigDecimal.TEN.pow(9)).toString()
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Perform error handling
}
```

## Sign Transaction

Let's now go through how can we sign the transaction. In the below codeblock, we'll create a new
function `prepareSignedTransaction` which can be used to retrive the Base58 signature as well as
broadcast transaction to the cluster. We'll use `TransferInstruction` to create the transaction to
self transfer 0.01 Sol and sign it.

```kotlin
private suspend fun prepareSignedTransaction(sender: Keypair) : Transaction = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    try {
        // highlight-next-start
        val blockHash = connection.getLatestBlockhash()
        val instruction = TransferInstruction(sender.publicKey, sender.publicKey, lamports = 10000000)
        val transaction = Transaction(blockHash, instruction, feePayer = sender.publicKey)
        transaction.sign(sender)
        transaction
        // highlight-next-end
    }catch (e: Exception) {
        throw e
    }
}
```

Once we have created `prepareSignedTransaction` function, we'll use it to prepare, sign the
transaction, and serialize it to get Base58 signature.

```kotlin
 try {
    val transaction = prepareSignedTransaction(sender)
    // focus-next-line
    val signedTransaction = Base58.encode(transaction.serialize())
} catch (e:Exception) {
    // Perform error handling
}
```

## Send Transaction

For the send transaction, we'll use `sendTransaction` method from `Connection` instance to broadcast
the result of `prepareSignedTransaction` to the cluster.

```kotlin
 try {
    val transaction = prepareSignedTransaction(sender)
    connection.sendTransaction(transaction = transaction)
} catch (e:Exception) {
    // Perform error handling
}
```
