Discord Login is a social login provider that allows users to sign in using their Discord credentials. Web3Auth supports Discord as a social login provider, allowing developers to offer a familiar and quick authentication method for users with Discord accounts.

To integrate Discord with Web3Auth, developers must first create a Discord App via the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

## Create a Discord app

1. Create a Discord [API application](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

2. Navigate to **OAuth2** from the sidebar, and paste the following as Redirect URI into the "Redirect URI" field.
   - https://auth.web3auth.io/auth

   ![Discord OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/img/authentication/discord/discord-redirect-uri.png)

3. Don't forget to save your changes!

4. Next, obtain the **"Client ID"** from here. We will use this in our Embedded Wallets Dashboard.

## Create a Discord Connection

:::success Enable on Dashboard

To use this feature, please enable `Discord` from the Social Connections section in the [Embedded Wallets Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

> By default, Web3Auth uses its own pre-configured credentials for Discord login.

:::

<div style={{ display: 'flex', margin: '20px 0', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src={DiscordToggle}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '800px',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
    alt="Toggle Discord Connection on Dashboard"
  />
</div>

Follow these steps to create a Discord connection:

1. Visit the [Embedded Wallets Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).
1. Go to the `Social Connections` section.
1. Click on the `Settings` icon near the Discord connection.
1. Enter the `Auth Connection ID`.
1. Enter the `Discord Client ID`.
1. Finally, click on the `Add Connection` button.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', margin: '20px 0', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src={DiscordConnection}
    style={{
      maxWidth: '600px',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
    alt="Discord Connection"
  />
</div>

## Usage

Since, the `Discord Connection` details are available from Dashboard, developers don't need to pass any additional parameters to the `Web3AuthProvider`.

> Follow our [Quick Starts](/quickstart/?product=EMBEDDED_WALLETS&walletAggregatorOnly=NO&framework=REACT&stepIndex=0) to setup the basic flow.
