:::warning

To ensure proper authentication with Web3Auth, it is necessary for the JWT header to have the `kid` field, while the payload data should have the `iat` field.

:::

When configuring Web3Auth's Custom Authentication, you may encounter JWT errors. Below is a list of these errors and the necessary steps to resolve them.

- [Invalid JWT Verifiers ID field](#invalid-jwt-verifiers-id-field)
  - Error occurred while verifying params could not verify identity
- [Failed to verify JWS signature](#failed-to-verify-jws-signature)
  - Error occurred while verifying params unable to verify jwt token
- [Duplicate Token](#duplicate-token)
  - Could not get result from torus nodes Duplicate token found
- [Expired Token](#expired-token)
  - Error occurred while verifying paramstimesigned is more than 1m0s ago
- [Mismatch JWT Validation field](#mismatch-jwt-validation-field)
- [Refresh Tokens?](#looking-for-refresh-tokens)

## Invalid `JWT Verifiers ID` field.

### Error occurred while verifying params could not verify identity

"Error occurred while verifying params could not verify identity" error could be because the `verifierIdField` of `extraLoginOptions` is different from the one you have set up during the creation of Verifiers (`JWT Verifiers ID`) on the Web3Auth dashboard.

- This is the `JWT Verifiers ID` field on the `Verifier Modal` of the Web3Auth dashboard.
  <img
    style={{ display: 'block', maxHeight: '200px', marginBottom: '20px' }}
    src={JWTVerifierID}
    alt="JWT Verifier ID - Troubleshoot"
  />
- Make sure, this matched with your code.

  ```tsx
  import { WALLET_ADAPTERS, CHAIN_NAMESPACES } from '@web3auth/base'

  await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
    loginProvider: 'jwt',
    extraLoginOptions: {
      domain: 'YOUR-AUTH0-DOMAIN',
      verifierIdField: 'sub', // <-- This is the JWT Verifiers ID field.
      response_type: 'token',
      scope: 'email profile openid',
    },
  })
  ```

## Failed to verify JWS signature.

### Error occurred while verifying params unable to verify jwt token

"Error occurred while verifying params unable to verify jwt token" error could be because of the following reasons:

- The verifier for your AuthAdapter might be wrong. Check to make sure the `verifier` field is set correctly.
- The JWT is not signed with the correct key(JWK).
- The JWKS endpoint is not reachable or doesn't return a valid JWK that was used to sign the JWT.
- The JWKS endpoint is incorrect on the Web3Auth Dashboard. Double check to confirm the correct JWKS endpoint.

    style={{ display: 'block', maxHeight: '200px', marginBottom: '20px' }}
    src={JWKSEndpoint}
    alt="JWKS Endpoint Field - Troubleshoot"
  />
- The JWKS is missing the `kid` field.
- The `kid` present in the JWT header is not present in the JWKS.

`sample jwks`:

```tsx
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "e": "AQAB",
      "use": "sig",
      "kid": "YOUR-KID", // <-- This is the kid.
      "n": "YOUR-N",
      "alg": "RS256" // <-- This is the algorithm.
    }
  ]
}
```

`sample jwks endpoint`: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs

## Duplicate token

### Could not get result from torus nodes Duplicate token found

- "Could not get result from torus nodes Duplicate token found" error is thrown when the JWT is sent twice in the same request.

  ```tsx
  await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.AUTH, {
    loginProvider: 'jwt',
    extraLoginOptions: {
      id_token: 'ID_TOKEN', // <-- JWT should be unique for each request.
      verifierIdField: 'sub',
    },
  })
  ```

## Expired token

### Error occurred while verifying paramstimesigned is more than 1m0s ago

:::warning

Web3Auth accepts only those JWTs whose `iat` is less than the current time and is not greater than `60s` from current time. Regardless of the `exp` field of the JWT.

- In short, the JWT is considered expired if the `iat` is greater than `60s` from current time.

:::

"Error occurred while verifying paramstimesigned is more than 1m0s ago 2022-02-24 13:46:05 +0000 UTC" error could be because:

- JWT is expired.
- The JWT's `exp` field is less than the current time.
- The JWT's `iat` field is greater than `60s` from current time.

## Mismatch JWT Validation field

This error occurred when the validation field in the JWT is not matching with the validation field entered during the creation of Verifiers on the Web3Auth dashboard.

- This is the `JWT Validation` field on the `Verifier Modal` of the Web3Auth configuration.
  <img
    style={{ display: 'block', maxHeight: '200px', marginBottom: '20px' }}
    src={JWTValidation}
    alt="JWT Validation Field - Troubleshoot"
  />
- Make sure, these fields are present in the JWT Payload and matches with the JWT.

## Looking for Refresh Tokens?

A Refresh Token is a unique token that is used to obtain additional access tokens from an Authentication Service Provider. With Web3Auth, we verify the validity of the **id_token** and compare its payload value to the JWKS provided by either the Auth provider or your custom JWKS. And with Refresh Token, one can get a new id_token. And that id_token will be passed to Web3Auth, essentially making another login request.

#### What problem does the Refresh Token solve?

It enables users to maintain longer authentication sessions without the need for constant re-login. Although we do not support Refresh Tokens to maintain longer sessions, we do offer session management. The **Session Management** feature allows checking and maintaining existing sessions with Web3Auth.

During login with Web3Auth, pass the `sessionTime` parameter. It will **allow users to stay authenticated with Web3Auth for up to 1 day by default or a maximum of 30 days** until they log out or their session data is cleared.
