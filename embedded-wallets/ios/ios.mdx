For using Web3Auth natively in iOS/Swift, Web3Auth provides an
[iOS SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk), written in Swift. The Web3Auth iOS SDK is
a client-side library you can use with your iOS app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It returns
a private key generated in a non custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This
authentication can be achieved by using any of the social logins Web3Auth provides or using a custom
authentication flow of your choice.
