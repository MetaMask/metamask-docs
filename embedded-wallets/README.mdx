MetaMask Embedded Wallets (formerly Web3Auth) is a pluggable embedded wallet infrastructure that simplifies Web3 wallet integration and user onboarding. It supports OAuth-based logins and multiple platforms, allowing users to access Web3 applications through familiar authentication methods in under a minute.

Users enjoy seamless onboarding while maintaining full control of their non-custodial wallets, ensuring both convenience and security.

:::note

The SDKs are now branded as MetaMask Embedded Wallet SDKs (formerly Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs). Package names and APIs remain Web3Auth (for example, Web3Auth React SDK), and code snippets may reference `web3auth` identifiers.
