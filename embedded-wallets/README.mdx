## Is Web3Auth a Wallet?

Web3Auth is not a wallet, but rather a wallet infrastructure that can be integrated into any application. It provides customizable authentication flows for dApps and blockchain wallets, solving user onboarding and key management challenges.

Unlike traditional wallets that can limit user experience, Web3Auth enables developers to create tailored flows without requiring users to understand complex blockchain concepts. It provides a cryptographic key provider that can be used to build custom wallets or integrate with existing ones through Web3Auth's external wallet adapters.

## Is Web3Auth Scalable?

Web3Auth is built on a highly scalable infrastructure designed to handle millions of users. Our architecture provides:

- Global availability across multiple regions with consistent low-latency performance worldwide
- Automatic horizontal scaling that adjusts capacity based on demand, eliminating bottlenecks and ensuring uninterrupted service
- Enhanced security and reliability through distributed MPC architecture, maintaining Web3Auth's track record of zero downtime over three years of operation
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure running on Kubernetes orchestration for maximum reliability and performance
