The Project Analytics section in the Web3Auth Dashboard provides developers with a comprehensive overview of user activity and project engagement. This analytics system gathers and visualizes key data points to help developers monitor authentication trends, evaluate project performance, and make informed decisions to enhance user experience.

By offering visibility into user behavior and system usage, analytics empowers teams to optimize authentication flows, track growth, and ensure the platform's reliability at scale.

## Key Metrics and Insights

### Total Logins

Displays the cumulative number of login events across the project. This metric helps developers gauge overall user activity and identify spikes or patterns in login frequency.

### Monthly Active Wallets (MAWs)

Reflects the number of unique wallets that have interacted with the application within a given month. This is a critical metric for tracking user retention and engagement over time.

### Monthly Active Wallets Overview

A visual breakdown of MAWs is presented in the form of a pie chart. This chart provides a quick snapshot of wallet activity distribution, highlighting the proportion of users by wallet type or authentication method.

### Connections Used

Lists the types of authentication connections utilized across the project—such as social logins, passwordless methods, and external wallets—giving insight into the preferred login flows.
