Before implementing any Web3Auth SDK, developers must create a new project in the Web3Auth Dashboard. This process generates a Client ID required for Web3Auth SDK integration.

:::success Note

It is recommended to maintain separate projects for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to ensure optimal security of credentials.

:::

## Create a new project

Login to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and create a new project if you haven't already.

## Get the Client ID

After creating a project, navigate to **Project Settings** and select the **General** tab to obtain the `Client ID`.

The project comes pre-configured with default connections, chains and networks to facilitate faster integration with Web3Auth SDK.

For detailed implementation steps, developers can refer to the [Quickstart Guide](/quick-start) to integrate Web3Auth SDK into their applications.

## Dashboard Configuration

Once your project is created, you can configure various aspects of your Web3Auth integration through the dashboard:

- **[Project Settings](./project-settings)** - Configure general settings, domain whitelisting, and advanced options
- **[Chains and Networks](./chains-and-networks)** - Manage blockchain networks and custom chain configurations
- **[Authentication](./authentication)** - Configure login methods, social connections, and custom authentication
- **[Wallet Services](./wallet-services)** - Customize wallet UI and configure wallet features
- **[Customization](./customization)** - Brand your login flow and customize the user experience
- **[Analytics](./analytics)** - Monitor project usage and user engagement metrics
