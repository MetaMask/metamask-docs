To get started, visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), log in using one of your social accounts or use your email address. You can use the Dashboard to manage your projects, configurations, wallet UI, and more for MetaMask Embedded Wallets (formerly Web3Auth).

While setting up your account, Web3Auth will prompt you to share some basic information about your organization.

<div style={{ flexBasis: '300px', flexGrow: '1', textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src={DashboardSignUpPage}
    style={{ alignSelf: 'center', maxWidth: '100%' }}
    alt="Dashboard Sign Up Gif"
  />
</div>

Once you've set up your account, you can use the Dashboard to manage your **projects** and **team**.

:::tip

Use the [Projects](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/organization) page of the Dashboard to create and manage new projects for your account. Resources, including wallets, authentication methods, and more are scoped to individual projects.

## Create a new project

Before implementing any Embedded Wallet SDK, developers must create a new project in the Dashboard. This process generates a Client ID required for SDK integration.

:::success Note

It is recommended to maintain separate projects for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to ensure optimal security of credentials.

:::

Login to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and create a new project if you haven't already.

## Get the Client ID

After creating a project, navigate to **Project Settings** and select the **General** tab to obtain the `Client ID`.

The project comes pre-configured with default connections, chains and networks to facilitate faster integration with the SDKs.

## Dashboard Configuration

Once your project is created, you can configure various aspects of your integration through the dashboard:

- **[Project Settings](./project-settings)** - Configure general settings, domain whitelisting, and advanced options
- **[Chains and Networks](./chains-and-networks)** - Manage blockchain networks and custom chain configurations
- **[Authentication](./authentication)** - Configure login methods, social connections, and custom authentication
- **[Wallet Services](./wallet-services)** - Customize wallet UI and configure wallet features
- **[Customization](./customization)** - Brand your login flow and customize the user experience
- **[Analytics](./analytics)** - Monitor project usage and user engagement metrics
