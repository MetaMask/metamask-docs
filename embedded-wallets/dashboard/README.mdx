import DashboardSignUpPage from '@site/static/img/w3a-dashboard/dashboard-signup.gif'

To get started, visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), log in using one of your social accounts or use your email address. You can use the Dashboard to manage your projects, configurations, wallet UI, and more.

While setting up your account, Web3Auth will prompt you to share some basic information about your organization.

<div style={{ flexBasis: '300px', flexGrow: '1', textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src={DashboardSignUpPage}
    style={{ alignSelf: 'center', maxWidth: '100%' }}
    alt="Dashboard Sign Up Gif"
  />
</div>

Once you've set up your account, you can use the Dashboard to manage your **projects** and **team**.

Use the [Projects](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/organization) page of the Dashboard to create and manage new projects for your account. Resources within Web3Auth, including wallets, authentication methods, and more are scoped to individual projects.

Use the **Settings** page of the Dashboard to invite other administrators for your account. All administrators for your account can log in to the Dashboard, access credentials, and manage projects and configurations.
