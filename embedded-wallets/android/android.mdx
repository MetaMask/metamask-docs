The Web3Auth [Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-android-sdk) is a client-side library you can use with your Android app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. For using Web3Auth natively in Android, Web3Auth provides an Android SDK written in _Kotlin_. It returns a private key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This authentication can be achieved by using any social login options that Web3Auth supports or custom authentication flow of your choice.
