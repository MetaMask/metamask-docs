For using Web3Auth in React Native, Web3Auth provides an
[React Native SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk), written in TypeScript.
The Web3Auth React Native SDK is a client-side library you can use with your React Native app to
authenticate users using Web3Auth. It returns a private key generated in a non-custodial way on
successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of the
social logins Web3Auth provides or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

### Requirements

- React Native Release 0.71 and above (for Bare React Native Workflow)

- Expo SDK 48 and above (for Expo Managed Workflow)

- iOS Platform Target Version 14 and above

- Android Target SDK Version 31 and above

:::warning

The Web3Auth React Native PnP SDK is not compatible with "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with
Custom Dev Client and EAS builds. Please refer to the troubleshooting section for more on this.

Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code based on the version of expo a project has
installed, before moving forward.
