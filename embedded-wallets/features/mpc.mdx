Multi-Party Computation (MPC) powers MetaMask Embedded Wallets' non-custodial key management, enabling secure access and signing without exposing a full private key.

## Understanding MPC in MetaMask Embedded Wallets

MetaMask Embedded Wallets utilizes Threshold Cryptography, a principle of MPC, to ensure that a user can access their private key or generate transaction signatures only if they meet a specified threshold - typically 2 out of n key shares.

This section is an overview of MPC in MetaMask Embedded Wallets. For an in-depth understanding, it might be helpful to read through [How Embedded Wallets Work](/embedded-wallets/how-it-works) and [Wallet Management and Security of our Infrastructure](/embedded-wallets/infrastructure/).

### Design Goals

- **Seamless User Experience:** MetaMask Embedded Wallets aims to provide a frictionless non-custodial wallet experience.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Ensures integration with existing authentication methods and blockchain ecosystems.
- **Global Performance & Scalability:** Designed to meet the expansive demands of the Web3 market efficiently.

### 2-of-3 setup

1. **OAuth login share:** Via the Web3Auth Network (e.g., Google).
2. **Device share:** Stored on-device, protected by OS security/biometrics.
3. **Backup/2FA share:** User-controlled recovery using a high-entropy secret.

### Implementation variants

1. **Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS):** Reconstructs the key when the threshold is met.
2. **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS):** Creates partial signatures; no key reconstruction.

Both methods adhere to the core concept of threshold-based security but differ in their approach to wallet management and signature generation.

## Wallet Management Infrastructure

The Wallet Management Infrastructure distributes key shares so the full private key is never stored or exposed. The social-login share is generated by the Web3Auth Network using a 5/9 consensus, keeping wallets non-custodial. See the [Wallet Management Infrastructure](/embedded-wallets/infrastructure/) docs for details.
