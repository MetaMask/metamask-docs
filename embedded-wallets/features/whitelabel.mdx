MetaMask Embedded Wallets provide a prebuilt, customizable UI for authentication and wallet management that you can theme to your brand, localize, and fine‑tune for your user journey. If you prefer, you can also run fully headless with no UI shown as well.

## Customizable UI

The MetaMask Embedded Wallets experience includes configurable UI delivered via the Web3Auth Dashboard. With the Embedded Wallet SDKs, you can:

- **Customize the login modal:** Adapt the login modal to match your brand: colors, logos, fonts, and button styles.
- **Configure user flow and MFA screen transitions:** Choose the authentication flow and MFA screen transitions in the Dashboard to fit your UX.

- **Localize languages and text:** Switch between multiple languages to serve global audiences.
  - **Multi‑language support:** English, Spanish, German, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, French, Portuguese, Turkish, Dutch

  - Open‑source locales: contribute or extend translations

    :::tip

    Contribute your translations to the [Web3Auth Locales](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-locales) repository for them to be included in the next release.

## Headless mode (no UI)

Prefer to keep MetaMask/Web3Auth UI invisible? You can implement your own screens and flows while using the same Web3Auth SDKs under the hood. This gives you full control over the UX while retaining authentication, key management, and wallet functionality.
