MetaMask Embedded Wallets provide a prebuilt, customizable UI for authentication and wallet management that you can theme to your brand, localize, and fine‑tune for your user journey. If you prefer, you can also run fully headless with no UI shown as well.

## Customizable UI

The MetaMask Embedded Wallets experience includes configurable UI delivered via the Embedded Wallets dashboard. With the Embedded Wallet SDKs, you can:

- **Customize the login modal:** Adapt the login modal to match your brand: colors, logos, fonts, and button styles.
- **Configure user flow and MFA screen transitions:** Choose the authentication flow and MFA screen transitions in the dashboard to fit your UX.

- **Localize languages and text:** Switch between multiple languages to serve global audiences.
  - **Multi‑language support:** English, Spanish, German, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, French, Portuguese, Turkish, Dutch, and more.

  - Open‑source locales: contribute or extend translations.

    :::tip

    Contribute your translations to the [Web3Auth Locales](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-locales) repository for them to be included in the next release.

    :::

- Launch the Embedded Wallet UI for asset management (balances, tokens, NFTs), on‑ramps, transactions, and more.

## Headless mode (no UI)

Prefer to keep the MetaMask/Embedded Wallets UI invisible? You can implement your own screens and flows while using the same Embedded Wallets SDKs under the hood. This gives you full control over the UX while retaining authentication, key management, and wallet functionality.
