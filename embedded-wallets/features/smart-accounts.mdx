Create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a few lines of code, using our native smart accounts. With smart accounts, you can offer enhanced control and programmability, such as these listed below:

- **Gas Sponsorship:** Cover transaction fees, or allow users to pay for their own transactions using ERC-20 tokens.

- **Batch Transactions:** Perform multiple transactions in a single call.

- **Automated Transactions:** Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH hits $4,000.

- **Set Spending Limits:** Allow users to set tailored spending limits.

## Getting Started

Our native smart accounts powered by Account Abstraction (AA) simplify setup, enabling you to create and manage smart accounts effortlessly with popular libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Web3.js â€”no need for third-party packages to achieve ERC-4337 compatibility. We are working closely with different partners in the account abstraction ecosystem and will provide support for evolving standards like EIP-7702, ERC-7579 (Modular Accounts), and ERC-7555 (account discovery) as they get finalized.
