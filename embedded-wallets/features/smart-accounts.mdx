Create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a single toggle on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), using our native smart accounts. With smart accounts, you can offer enhanced control and programmability, such as these listed below:

- **Gas Sponsorship:** Cover transaction fees, or allow users to pay for their own transactions using ERC-20 tokens.

- **Batch Transactions:** Perform multiple transactions in a single call.

- **Automated Transactions:** Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH hits $4,000.

- **Set Spending Limits:** Allow users to set tailored spending limits.

- **Automatic Paymaster and Bundler Generation:** No need to manage paymasters and bundlers manually. Powered by Infura & Pimlico, the URLs are automatically generated for you.

## Getting Started

Our native smart accounts powered by [MetaMask Delegation Toolkit](/delegation-toolkit) simplify setup, enabling you to create and manage smart accounts effortlessly with popular libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Wagmi â€”no need for third-party packages to achieve ERC-4337 compatibility.

We are working closely with different partners in the account abstraction ecosystem and will provide support for evolving standards like EIP-7702, ERC-7579 (Modular Accounts), and ERC-7555 (account discovery) as they get finalized.

:::note

Getting started is easy; you just have to select your preferred smart account provider, configure your bundler client, and integrate your paymaster. [See this link for the steps.](/embedded-wallets/sdk/react/advanced/smart-accounts/)
