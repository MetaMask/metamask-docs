Create and manage smart accounts for your users with just a single toggle on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), using our native smart accounts. 

With smart accounts, you can offer enhanced control and programmability, such as:

- **Gas sponsorship:** Cover transaction fees, or allow users to pay for their own transactions using ERC-20 tokens.

- **Batch transactions:** Perform multiple transactions in a single call.

- **Automated transactions:** Allow users to automate actions, like swapping ETH to USDT when ETH hits $4,000.

- **Set spending limits:** Allow users to set tailored spending limits.

- **Automatic paymaster and bundler generation:** No need to manage paymasters and bundlers manually. Powered by Infura & Pimlico, the URLs are automatically generated for you.

## Getting started

Our native smart accounts powered by [MetaMask Smart Accounts kit](/smart-accounts-kit) simplifies set up, enabling you to create and manage smart accounts effortlessly with popular libraries like Viem, Ethers, and Wagmi — no need for third-party packages to achieve ERC-4337 compatibility.

We are working closely with different partners in the account abstraction ecosystem and will provide support for evolving standards like EIP-7702, ERC-7579 (Modular Accounts), and ERC-7555 (account discovery) as they reach finalization.
