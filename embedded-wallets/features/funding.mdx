MetaMask Embedded Wallets supports multiple ways for users to add funds to their wallets. Let users pick the method that suits them:

- Buy crypto with card, bank transfer, or local payment methods (fiat on‑ramp aggregator).
- Transfer from an existing wallet or exchange.
- Connect an external wallet and deposit to the embedded wallet.

## Buy crypto with card or bank transfer (fiat on‑ramp aggregator)

The fiat on‑ramp aggregator, a key component of the Embedded Wallets' services, streamlines the process of converting fiat to cryptocurrency. With integration requiring just a single line of code, it supports over 100 payment methods.

:::note

The fiat on-ramp supports both Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Account Abstraction (AA) accounts powered by Embedded Wallets' native account abstraction.

Additionally, it supports both EVM and Solana accounts, providing a versatile solution for various blockchain environments.

### Using the Wallet Services UI

When the user clicks **Add Funds** on the Wallet Services UI, they'll be presented with options to fund their wallet:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', margin: '20px 0', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/embedded-wallets/wallet-services/ws-funding-add-funds.png"
    alt="Add Funds Options"
    style={{
      maxWidth: '300px',
      border: '1px solid #eaeaea',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
  />
</div>

Users can choose to fund by card or QR code.

#### Fund by card

Users select the card option to purchase crypto using a credit or debit card. This takes them to the card payment interface:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', margin: '20px 0', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/embedded-wallets/wallet-services/ws-funding-card.png"
    alt="Fund by Card"
    style={{
      maxWidth: '300px',
      border: '1px solid #eaeaea',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
  />
</div>

#### Fund by QR Code

Users select the QR code option to fund their wallet by scanning a QR code with another wallet:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', margin: '20px 0', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/img/embedded-wallets/wallet-services/ws-funding-qr.png"
    alt="Fund by QR Code"
    style={{
      maxWidth: '300px',
      border: '1px solid #eaeaea',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
    }}
  />
</div>

## Overcome on-ramping challenges

The fiat on‑ramp aggregator addresses your on-ramping challenges:

- **Global reach:** Access users in over 50 countries with worldwide payment coverage.

- **Lower fees:** Save up to 70% on transaction fees by leveraging lower cost local payment providers.

- **Localized payment options:** Offer familiar and real-time payment methods to boost user engagement and monetization.

- **Higher transaction success rates:** Address high failure rates (30-70%) of traditional methods like Visa/Mastercard in emerging markets by using reliable local payment options.

- **Enhanced security:** Provide a secure and cost-effective solution for both users and merchants, as local payment methods often require 2-factor authentication (2FA) and eliminate chargeback costs.

## Transfer from another wallet

The UI lets users fund their embedded wallet by sending crypto from a self‑custodial wallet or an exchange:

1. Display the user's embedded wallet address (or QR code), or helps you directly connect to the user's wallet.
2. From an external wallet, send funds to that address on a supported network.
3. Confirm the deposit and update balances in your app.
