MetaMask Embedded Wallets supports multiple ways for users to add funds to their wallets. Let users pick the method that suits them:

- Buy crypto with card, bank transfer, or local payment methods (Fiat On‑Ramp Aggregator).
- Transfer from an existing wallet or exchange.
- Connect an external wallet and deposit to the embedded wallet.

## Buy crypto with card or bank transfer (Fiat On‑Ramp Aggregator)

The Fiat On-Ramp Aggregator, a key component of the Wallet Services, streamlines the process of converting fiat to cryptocurrency. With integration requiring just a single line of code, it supports over 100 payment methods.

:::note

The Fiat on Ramp supports both Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Account Abstraction (AA) accounts powered by Web3Auth Native Account Abstraction.

Additionally, it supports both EVM and Solana accounts, providing a versatile solution for various blockchain environments.

:::

Here's how our aggregator addresses your on-ramping challenges:

- **Global Reach:** Access users in over 50 countries with worldwide payment coverage

- **Lower fees:** Save up to 70% on transaction fees by leveraging lower cost local payment providers

- **Localized Payment Options:** Offer familiar and real-time payment methods to boost user engagement and monetization

- **Higher Transaction Success Rates:** Address high failure rates (30-70%) of traditional methods like Visa/Mastercard in emerging markets by using reliable local payment options.

- **Enhanced Security:** Provide a secure and cost-effective solution for both users and merchants, as local payment methods often require 2-factor authentication (2FA) and eliminate chargeback costs.

## Transfer from another wallet

The UI lets users fund their embedded wallet by sending crypto from a self‑custodial wallet or an exchange:

1. Display the user's embedded wallet address (or QR code), or helps you directly connect to the user's wallet.
2. From an external wallet, send funds to that address on a supported network.
3. Confirm the deposit and update balances in your app.
