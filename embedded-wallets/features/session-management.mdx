SDKs provide session management to minimize repeated logins, enhancing user experience by maintaining login state for a specified duration. This seamless experience offers several advantages, including:

- **User Experience:** Reduces login frequency for a smoother experience.
- **Efficiency:** Session restoration is quick, occurring in milliseconds.
- **Integration:** Easy to implement with minimal impact on user flow.

### Session Key

Upon login, a unique session key is generated. The user state is then encrypted with this session key and stored on the Web3Auth metadata server.

### Secure Storage

Session keys are stored securely in the client's environment (e.g., browser local storage, Android Encrypted Shared Preferences, iOS Keychain Services).

### Restoration

1. **Retrieve Key:** SDK retrieves the session key from secure storage.
2. **Server Communication:** SDK requests user state restoration from the metadata server.
3. **Decryption:** Encrypted user state is decrypted with the session key.
4. **Fallback:** If no active session, user proceeds with standard login.
