Pregenerated Wallets simplify user onboarding by creating wallets for your users before they log in. This approach enables a smoother Web3 experience, giving developers flexibility in introducing wallet functionalities to users at the right time.

## Why Use Pregenerated Wallets?

- **Seamless Onboarding:** Create wallets as part of the invite or signup process, so users can jump into your app without additional steps.
- **Deferred Wallet Setup:** Delay login setups (e.g., OAuth or passkeys) until users are ready for their first on-chain transaction.
- **Pre-Funding Capability:** Send tokens or rewards to wallets before users claim them, perfect for airdrops, welcome bonuses, or preloaded assets.

## Use Cases

- **Early Wallet Creation:** Assign wallets to users during onboarding or invitations without requiring immediate login.
- **Preloaded Incentives:** Reward users with tokens, NFTs, or other assets for off-chain activities, redeemable when they access their wallets.
- **Enhanced Gaming & App Experiences:** Preload game items or promotional rewards to create a frictionless user journey.

## Utilizing the Pregenerated Wallet API

We provide a straightforward API to facilitate the creation of pre-generated EOA wallets. You can integrate this API into your user signup flow, either after a user verifies their email or independently by supplying their email or unique identifier to the API.

:::note

Access to Wallet Pregeneration is gated. You can use this feature in `sapphire_devnet` for free. The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this feature in a production environment is the **Scale Plan**.

:::warning

This API only returns the Core Kit/ SFA Key wallet addresses. To use the wallet addresses with the Web3Auth SDKs, you will need to either use the `useCoreKitKey` or `useSFAKey` flag in our SDKs

### Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Users:** Determine the unique identifier or email for the user within your system. This will be the `verifierId` used to create the wallet.
2. **API Call:** Use the provided API to submit the user's identifier. You'll need to specify parameters from the dashboard, specifically the Verifier Name, Web3Auth Network, and Client Id.
3. **Receive Wallet Address:** The API response will include the new wallet address, ready for use by the user upon their first login.
