Embedded Wallets NFT Minting Service facilitates NFT airdrops and minting, giving you granular control over the process. The NFT Minting API is designed to facilitate the minting process for specified NFTs, supporting large-scale, gasless minting via our advanced batch minting infrastructure. This API is ideal for scenarios such as Airdrops, free mints, and situations where you prefer to manage fiat payments on your own.

## How it works

To initiate the minting process, provide the API with the necessary contract details, token ID, and recipient wallet address. The Embedded Wallets infrastructure will take care of the rest, ensuring a seamless and efficient minting experience. Web3Auth supports ERC-721 and ERC-1155 smart contracts across all EVM-compatible networks.
