Web3Auth NFT Minting Service facilitates NFT airdrops and minting, giving you granular control over the process. The NFT Minting API is designed to facilitate the minting process for specified NFTs, supporting large-scale, gasless minting via our advanced batch minting infrastructure. This API is ideal for scenarios such as Airdrops, free mints, and situations where you prefer to manage fiat payments on your own.
