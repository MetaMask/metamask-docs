# Extend the functionality of MetaMask using Snaps

MetaMask Snaps is an open source system that allows anyone to safely extend the functionality of MetaMask,
creating new web3 end user experiences.

Want to build your own Snaps? Get started by [installing MetaMask Flask](get-started/install-flask.md).

:::note
To learn how to integrate your dapp with MetaMask, visit the 
[MetaMask wallet developer documentation](../wallet).

## What is a snap?

A snap is a JavaScript program run in an isolated environment that customizes the wallet experience.
Snaps have access to a limited set of capabilities, determined by the
[permissions](how-to/request-permissions.md) the user granted them during installation.

## What can you do with a snap?

A snap can add new API methods to MetaMask, add support for different blockchain protocols, or
modify existing functionalities using the [Snaps JSON-RPC API](reference/rpc-api.md).

Features include:
