# Extend the functionality of MetaMask using Snaps

Snaps is an open source system that allows anyone to safely extend the functionality of
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), creating new web3 end user experiences.
Get started building your own Snaps by [installing MetaMask Flask](get-started/install-flask.md).

## What can you do with a Snap?

A Snap can add new API methods to MetaMask, add support for different blockchain protocols, or
modify existing functionalities using the [Snaps API](reference/snaps-api.md).
