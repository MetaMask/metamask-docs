# Snaps command line interface

This reference describes the syntax of the Snaps command line interface (CLI) subcommands and options.

Make sure to [install the Snaps CLI](../../get-started/install-snaps.md#install-the-snaps-cli).

You can specify subcommands and options using the `mm-snap` command:

```bash
mm-snap [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

You can also override the default values of the options by specifying them in the
[configuration file](../../concepts/anatomy.md#configuration-file).
