# Keyring API

This section provides a detailed reference on the Keyring API methods, objects, and events that
enable [custom EVM accounts](../../features/custom-evm-accounts/index.md).
The Keyring API consists of:

- [**Account Management API**](account-management/index.md) – An API for dapps to communicate with
  account management Snaps.
  Dapps can manage accounts and signature requests using this API.
- [**Chain Methods API**](chain-methods.md) - An API that contains chain-specific EVM methods that
  account management Snaps can choose to implement to support dapp requests from custom accounts.
