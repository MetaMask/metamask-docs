# Snaps security guidelines

This page outlines essential principles for builders to develop secure and reliable Snaps.
Use these guidelines when creating your Snap to ensure it is safe for users.

## Manage permissions

The following are guidelines for [managing permissions](../../how-to/request-permissions.md) in the Snap manifest file.

- **Minimum permissions** - Follow the principle of least authority by only adding the minimum
  permissions needed by your Snap in the manifest file.
  Before publishing your Snap, check the permissions again and remove any unused permissions.
  You can validate your permissions using the [Snaps Simulator Manifest
  Validator](https://metamask.github.io/snaps/snaps-simulator/staging/#/manifest).

- **Minimum RPC access** - When adding the [`endowment:rpc`](../../reference/permissions.md#endowmentrpc)
  permission for Snaps or dapps, ask yourself if both are necessary.
  For example, if permission is granted to communicate with Snaps, it means other Snaps can call
  your Snap's sensitive RPC methods.

- **Minimum network access** - Only add the [`endowment:network-access`](../../reference/permissions.md#endowmentnetwork-access)
  permission if it's absolutely necessary, such as when needing to communicate with a remote API
  that is part of your Snap's functionality.
  This to mitigate users' concern about sharing wallet usage to remote servers.
  If your Snap needs this permission, inform the user before communicating with remote servers and
  include a privacy policy in your Snap that explains how data is shared.

## Handle transactions securely

The following are guidelines for handling and signing transactions:

- **Transaction details** - When handling transactions, provide a prompt displaying
  all transaction details, including the receiver address, chain ID, network, and amount.
  Display the originating site's domain name and the target blockchain.
  Ensure the user verifies the receiver address to avoid sending funds to an incorrect destination.

- **Transparent signing** - Display the message to be signed by the user in the Snap confirmation flow.
  Do not rely on the requesting site to display this message, as it might choose not to, leading to the Snap signing the message silently.

- **Consentful confirmations** - Before signing a transaction, display a user confirmation prompt
  with all the transaction details as previously mentioned.

## Notify users

The following are guidelines for user notifications and authorizations:

- **Transparent and consentful actions** - Before performing any of the following actions, provide a
  prompt that displays detailed information about the action and asks the user to reject or accept it:
  - **Modifying or reading state.** (In general, notify the user about any state changes.)
  - **Switching networks or accounts.**
  - **Deriving or generating key pairs, accounts, or smart contracts.**
  - **Signing transactions.** (If your Snap is designed to allow automatic transactions, prompt the
    user before enabling this and make sure they know how it works.
    Also provide a way to disable it.)

- **Protect user keys** - Do not allow your Snap to return all user wallet addresses to the
  site, even public keys.
  Users should choose and authorize the addresses to expose.

- **Limit access to sensitive methods** - When building a Snap with sensitive RPC methods,
  use a companion dapp as an "admin interface" to interact with your Snap's sensitive methods.
  There are two ways to do this:
  
  1. Restrict the [`endowment:rpc`](../../reference/permissions.md#endowmentrpc) permission to specific
     URLs using the `allowedOrigins` caveat.
  
  2. Filter specific methods to specific URLs using the built-in [URL
     library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL): 

    ```javascript
    const referrer = new URL(origin);

    if(referrer.protocol === "https:" && 
       (referrer.host.endsWith(".metamask.io") || 
        referrer.host === "metamask.io")) { 
      console.log("URL is valid"); 
    }
    else { 
      console.log("URL is NOT valid"); 
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, the RPC method can be restricted when the origin matches `https://metamask.io`
    or any subdomain.
    This check can be used on any RPC method that should not be callable by all sites.

    :::note
    Avoid using regular expressions or string matching to filter URLs.
    The URL library provides a much more reliable interface for matching URLs.

## Secure sensitive information

The following are guidelines for handling sensitive or personally identifiable information such as
user IPs, emails, passwords, and private keys:

- **Logging** - Remove all logs to the JavaScript console that contain sensitive information.
  Disable all logging before publishing your Snap.

- **Errors** - Review parts of your code where errors and exceptions can be raised.
  In some cases, error stacks can be written to the console with sensitive information.
  This information can be captured in data logs, or a malicious actor can phish the user into
  copying and sending the error.

- **Private keys** - Avoid retrieving the user's private key from the Snap unless
  absolutely necessary, such as to sign a transaction.
  If you only need the user's public key, use [`snap_getBip32PublicKey`](../../reference/snaps-api.md#snap_getbip32publickey)
  instead of deriving it from the private key.
  Never return the private key in an RPC method to a dapp or another Snap.
  To give users a way to view their private key, display it in a dialog.

- **Limit exposure** - Avoid accidentally returning sensitive information from a method.
  For example, you might have a method that intends to return sensitive information only in specific
  cases, but due to a typo or bad logic, it returns the information incorrectly, leaking data.
  Even if you have a legitimate reason for allowing a user to export sensitive information, you
  should prevent that information from being revealed carelessly (similar to how MetaMask makes it
  difficult to reveal a Secret Recovery Phrase and for an observer looking over a user's shoulder to
  see it).

When in doubt, choose friction over convenience for sensitive information.

## Validate parameters

The following are guidelines for validating RPC parameters and handling values:

- **Validate user inputs** - Validate and sanitize user inputs coming into the Snap-exposed RPC methods.
  Never assume a parameter is safe to use.
  If unvalidated user inputs are used inside the logic of your Snap methods, a dapp or a user can
  exploit that logic in an unsafe way.

- **Get values from MetaMask** - Get values such as chain ID or address from MetaMask instead
  of the dapp.
  A dapp can accidentally or maliciously display incorrect values, tricking users into performing
  certain actions (for example, signing a transaction for a network to which they didn't intend to
  broadcast the transaction).
  If a dapp provides values that do not match the values from MetaMask, warn the user in your
  confirmation flow.

- **Use `copyable` for safe disclosures** - When displaying arbitrary content in a Snap dialog, such
  as for signing a message, use the [`copyable`](../../features/custom-ui.md#copyable) user
  interface component instead of `text`.
  When using dialogs, the input may contain special characters that render as Markdown and can
  mislead the user.
  For example: 

  ![Example not using copyable with Markdown rendering](../../assets/copyable-example-1.png)

  The special characters `*` and `_` render Markdown formatting, so what the user sees does not
  match the content.
  To avoid this, use `copyable` instead:

  ![Example using copyable with clean rendering](../../assets/copyable-example-2.png)

  `copyable` does not render Markdown and has the added benefit that the user can select to copy the content.
  Also, the formatting provides a visual delineator to separate arbitrary input or fields from user
  interface text.

- **Check transaction data size** - Check the size of the ABI-encoded transaction data's function arguments.
  The ABI specification requires all arguments, regardless of their type, to be 32 bytes.
  If an argument is not 32 bytes, the calling contract's behavior might depend on the contract
  compiler version.
  For example, Solidity 0.5.0 treats these non-aligned arguments as invalid and reverts the function call.
  Older Solidity versions automatically append zeros at the end of the transaction data to ensure
  all arguments are 32 bytes.
  An attacker can exploit this feature to bypass security checks implemented in the corresponding
  contract function that reads those function arguments.

## Avoid using deprecated methods

Avoid using the following deprecated methods:

- `wallet_enable`, which is deprecated in favor of
  [`wallet_requestSnaps`](/wallet/reference/wallet_requestsnaps).

- `snap_confirm`, which is deprecated in favor of [`snap_dialog`](../../reference/snaps-api.md#snap_dialog).

- `endowment:long-running`, which is deprecated for MetaMask stable but still allowed in MetaMask Flask.

## Coding best practices

The following are coding security tips and warnings:

- **SES compatibility** - Use packages or libraries compatible with SES (hardened JavaScript).
  If you don't, you might encounter errors that require [patching a specific
  dependency](../../how-to/debug-a-snap/common-issues.md#patch-dependencies) to fix.

- **Timers and side-channel attacks** - Certain JavaScript features such as timers (for example,
  `Date.now`) can expose critical system information, making a user vulnerable to
  [side-channel attacks](https://www.rambus.com/blogs/side-channel-attacks/).
  In the Snaps execution environment, the precision of these timers has been reduced to prevent this.

- **Unsafe cryptographic libraries** - Avoid using unsafe cryptographic libraries.
  Do not use `Math.random`, which is not sufficiently random for generating cryptographic hashes and
  can expose a user to reverse engineering or brute-forcing keys in the future.
  Do not use insufficient hashing algorithms such as `md5` or `sha2`.
  Do not roll your own cryptography or use custom or unproven cryptography methods or libraries.

  We recommend using [`snap_getEntropy`](../../reference/snaps-api.md#snap_getentropy) for entropy, the
  built-in [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) or
  [Noble cryptography libraries](https://paulmillr.com/noble/), and safe hashing algorithms such as `sha256`.
  Choose audited, widely used libraries over obscure, untested implementations.

## Manage dependencies

The following are guidelines for securing your supply chain:

- **Pin npm package dependencies** - Pin all npm package dependencies in the Snap's dependency tree
  to exact versions.
  If you don't, a supply chain attacker can trick you into including a malicious version of a
  package instead of the original, legitimate one.
  You can quickly check the status of your dependencies by running `npm audit` in your Snap directory.

- **Secure your stack** - Your Snap companion dapp and any remote servers are part of your security model.
  We recommend using [LavaMoat](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat) to secure relevant parts of
  your stack and following security best practices for your dapp or server.

## Publish and serve your Snap

The following are guidelines for making your Snap available to users safely:

- **Snap updates** - When serving a Snap from a dapp, make sure users are getting the latest version
  of your Snap.
  Do not allow any actions on the dapp before reconnecting it to MetaMask and loading a new or
  updated version of the Snap.
  This prevents users from using outdated versions of the Snap that may have potential bugs and
  security issues.

- **Snap publication** - Ensure correct publication of the Snap.
  Only publish the `packages/snap` folder, and not the entire GitHub repository for a project.

- **Other wallet extensions** - Be aware that if the user has other wallet browser extensions
  installed, a call to the MetaMask provider `window.ethereum` can be overridden.
  [Connect to Snaps using EIP-6963](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/discussions/2001) to reliably
  access the MetaMask provider.

## Conclusion

In general, when developing Snaps, put yourself in the user's shoes and consider how they use MetaMask.
Always prioritize their privacy and the security of their assets.
