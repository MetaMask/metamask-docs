# Request permissions

[Snaps must request permission](#request-permissions-from-a-snap) to access certain powerful
JavaScript globals or API methods.
[Dapps must also request permission](#request-permissions-from-a-dapp) to access certain API methods
to communicate with Snaps.

Snaps and dapps follow the [EIP-2255 wallet permissions specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2255).

## Request permissions from a Snap

### Snaps API methods

Request permission to call [Snaps API methods](../reference/snaps-api.md) in the
`initialPermissions` field of the Snap [manifest file](../concepts/files.md#manifest-file).
For example, to request to call [`snap_dialog`](../reference/snaps-api.md#snap_dialog), add the
following to the manifest file:

```json title="snap.manifest.json"
"initialPermissions": {
  "snap_dialog": {}
}
```

### Endowments

Endowments are a type of permission.
Request endowments in the `initialPermissions` field of the Snap
[manifest file](../concepts/files.md#manifest-file).
See the [Snaps permissions reference](../reference/permissions.md) for the full list of endowments.

For example, to request the [`endowment:network-access`](../reference/permissions.md#endowmentnetwork-access)
permission, add the following to the manifest file:

```json title="snap.manifest.json"
"initialPermissions": {
  "endowment:network-access": {}
}
```

### Dynamic permissions

Dynamic permissions are not requested in the manifest file.
Instead, your Snap can acquire dynamic permissions during its lifecycle.

For example, request permission to call the [`eth_accounts`](/wallet/reference/eth_accounts)
MetaMask JSON-RPC API method by calling [`eth_requestAccounts`](/wallet/reference/eth_requestaccounts).
See the [`eth_accounts` dynamic permission](../reference/permissions.md#eth_accounts) for more information.

## Request permissions from a dapp

Dapps that communicate with Snaps must request permission to do so by calling the
`wallet_requestSnaps` MetaMask JSON-RPC API method.

For example, to request permission to connect to the `hello-snap` Snap:

```js title="index.js"
await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'wallet_requestSnaps',
  params: {
    'npm:hello-snap': {},
  },
});
```
