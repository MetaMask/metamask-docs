# Allow automatic connections

You can authorize specific dapps or Snaps to automatically connect to your Snap, skipping the need
for users to manually confirm a connection when the dapp or Snap calls
[`wallet_requestSnaps`](../reference/wallet-api-for-snaps.md#wallet_requestsnaps).
This is useful, for example, for [Snaps used by multiple dapps](#snap-used-by-multiple-dapps) or
[Snaps installed from the Snaps directory](#snap-installed-from-the-snaps-directory).

## Steps

### 1. Add authorized dapps in `initialConnections`

Add an [`initialConnections`](../reference/permissions.md#initial-connections) field in the Snap
manifest file, specifying each dapp you want to allow to automatically connect.
For example:

```json title="snap.manifest.json"
"initialConnections": {
  "https://voyager-snap.linea.build": {}
}
```

:::caution important
`initialConnections` is not a replacement for [`endowment:rpc`](../reference/permissions.md#endowmentrpc).
`endowment:rpc` is still required to allow dapps or Snaps to call RPC methods of your Snap.
:::

When testing, you can specify the local site.
For example:

```json title="snap.manifest.json" 
"initialConnections": {
  "http://localhost:8000": {}
}
```

We recommend removing local sites before deploying your Snap to production.

### 2. Connect to the Snap from an authorized dapp

When you visit a dapp specified in the Snap's `initialConnections`, and the dapp calls
[`wallet_requestSnaps`](../reference/wallet-api-for-snaps.md#wallet_requestsnaps), if the Snap is
already installed, the dapp connects immediately and can make further calls to the Snap.
If the Snap is not installed, you see a confirmation to install the Snap.

Additionally, since the connection between the Snap and a dapp listed in `initialConnections`
is automatic, calling [`wallet_getSnaps`](../reference/wallet-api-for-snaps.md#wallet_getsnaps) from
the dapp returns the Snap even if the dapp never called
[`wallet_requestSnaps`](../reference/wallet-api-for-snaps.md#wallet_requestsnaps).
This makes the flow of using the Snap from an authorized dapp completely seamless.

## Example

The following sample code, adapted from the
[Linea Voyager Snap](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-voyager-snap) companion dapp, shows the flow
of connecting to a Snap from a dapp authorized in `initialConnections`.

While the code is exactly the same as it would be without the dapp being listed in
`initialConnections`, the comments show how the flow is different from the user's perspective.

The key is that calling [`wallet_getSnaps`](../reference/wallet-api-for-snaps.md#wallet_getsnaps)
from an authorized dapp when the Snap is already installed returns that Snap even if the dapp never
explicitly connected to it by calling
[`wallet_requestSnaps`](../reference/wallet-api-for-snaps.md#wallet_requestsnaps).

```js title="script.js"
const snapId = "npm:@myorg/mysnap";

// This function is called when the EIP-6963 process of finding MetaMask is successful.
const MetaMaskFound = async (providerDetail) => {
  const { provider } = providerDetail;

  // This call returns the Snap ID if it is already installed.
  const snaps = await provider.request({
    method: "wallet_getSnaps",
  });

  if (Object.keys(snaps).includes(snapId)) {
    // If we're here, the Snap is installed. We're good to go.
    return;
  }

  // If we're here, the Snap is not installed. Let's install it.
  // Since the Snap is not installed, the user still sees a confirmation to install the Snap.
  try {
    const result = await provider.request({
      method: "wallet_requestSnaps",
      params: {
        [snapId]: {},
      },
    });

    // If we're here, the Snap is installed, and the dapp is successfully connected to it.
  } catch (err) {
    // If we're here, something went wrong. For example, the user might have declined the Snap
    // installation confirmation.
  }
};
```

## When to use initial connections

The following scenarios showcase `initialConnection`'s usefulness, in order from most to least useful:

#### Snap used by multiple dapps

This flow is as follows:

1. You build a Snap that can be used by multiple dapps, for example, a protocol Snap.
   You authorize an automatic connection to your Snap's companion dapp by listing it in `initialConnections`.
2. A user installs your Snap while interacting with a dapp that uses it.
3. The user lands on your Snap's companion dapp.
4. **The user can interact with the companion dapp without having to manually connect to the Snap.**

For even greater benefit, consider authorizing an automatic connection for some known dapps that
interact with your Snap.

#### Snap installed from the Snaps directory

This flow is as follows:

1. You build a Snap that is only really useful for one dapp, its companion dapp.
   You authorize an automatic connection to the companion dapp by listing it in `initialConnections`.
2. A user finds your Snap through the [Snaps directory](https://snaps.metamask.io) and installs it.
3. The user lands on your Snap's companion dapp.
4. **The user can interact with the companion dapp without having to manually connect to the Snap.**

#### Snap installed from your companion dapp

This flow is as follows:

1. You build a Snap, and authorize an automatic connection to its companion dapp by listing the dapp
   in `initialConnections`.
2. A user discovers your Snap through its companion dapp.
3. The user must install the Snap, going through the normal flow.

In this case, adding the companion dapp to `initialConnections` is not useful.
