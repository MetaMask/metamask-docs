# Publish a Snap

Snaps are npm packages, so publishing a Snap is as simple as publishing an npm package.
Refer to the [npm CLI documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish) for details
on publishing to the public registry.
The following details are specific to Snaps:

- The version in `package.json` and `snap.manifest.json` should match.
- The `repository.url` field in `package.json` should match the correct repository for your Snap.
- The `source.location.npm.packageName` in `snap.manifest.json` should match the name in `package.json`.
- The `proposedName` in `snap.manifest.json` should be a human-readable name and should not include
  the words "MetaMask" or "Snap." 
- The image specified in `iconPath` in the manifest file is used as the icon displayed when
  installing the Snap, in custom dialogs, and in the settings menu.
  - This icon should be a valid SVG.
  - The icon will be cropped in a circle when displayed in MetaMask; you do not need to make the icon circular.

After publishing the Snap, any dapp can connect to the Snap by using the Snap ID `npm:[packageName]`.

:::caution
If you are using the Snap monorepo project generated in the [quickstart](../get-started/quickstart.md),
make sure to only publish the Snap package in `/packages/snap`. 
You can use the [Snaps Simulator](https://metamask.github.io/snaps/snaps-simulator/staging/#/manifest) to verify 
that your Snap was published correctly &mdash; just select **localhost** in the top right corner and change the 
Snap location to **npm** and the ID of your Snap. 

Also, make sure to update the manifest file, icon file, and README to differentiate your Snap from the template.

## Distribute your Snap

You should deploy a companion dapp where users can learn about your Snap and install it, or
integrate with your existing dapp.

If your Snap is designed to communicate with dapps, you can encourage other dapp developers to
[connect to your Snap](connect-to-a-snap.md).
