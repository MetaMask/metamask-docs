# Install Snaps

To use Snaps, you must install [MetaMask Flask](#install-metamask-flask).

You can then [get started quickly using the Create Snap CLI](quickstart.md).

## Prerequisites

- Up-to-date Chromium or Firefox browser
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or later
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) version 3

## Install MetaMask Flask

[MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/) is a canary distribution for developers that provides
access to upcoming MetaMask features.
Snaps is the first feature rolled out in the Flask environment.

[Install Flask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask-flask-developmen/ljfoeinjpaedjfecbmggjgodbgkmjkjk)
in a new browser profile, or disable any existing installed versions of MetaMask before installing
Flask.

:::caution
Running multiple instances of MetaMask in the same browser profile breaks dapp interactions.
