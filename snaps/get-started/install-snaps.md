# Install Snaps

To install Snaps, you must [install the MetaMask Flask browser extension](#install-the-metamask-flask-browser-extension).

## Prerequisites

- Up-to-date Chromium or Firefox browser
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or later
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) version 3

## Install the MetaMask Flask browser extension

[MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/) is an experimental playground that provides developers 
access to upcoming MetaMask features. It is available as a browser extension.

Snaps is the first feature rolled out in the Flask environment.

:::caution Install in a new browser profile
Install the [Metamask Flask browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask-flask-developmen/ljfoeinjpaedjfecbmggjgodbgkmjkjk) in a new browser profile, or disable any existing installed versions of MetaMask before installing
Flask. Running multiple instances of MetaMask in the same browser profile breaks dapp interactions.
