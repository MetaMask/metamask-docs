# Snaps security guidelines

This page outlines essential principles for builders to develop secure and reliable Snaps.
Use these guidelines when creating your Snap to ensure it is safe for users.

## Permissions

The following are guidelines for using the Snap [manifest file](../concepts/anatomy.md/#manifest-file)
and its [permissions](../reference/permissions.md):

- **Minimum permissions** - Follow the principle of least authority: only add the minimum
  permissions needed by your Snap in the manifest file.
  Before publishing your Snap, check the permissions again and remove any unused permissions.
  You can validate your permissions using the [Snaps Simulator Manifest
  Validator](https://metamask.github.io/snaps/snaps-simulator/staging/#/manifest).

- **Minimum RPC access** - When adding the [`endowment:rpc`](../reference/permissions.md/#endowmentrpc)
  permission for Snaps or dapps, ask yourself if both are necessary.
  For example, if permission is granted to communicate with Snaps, it means other Snaps can call
  your Snap's sensitive RPC methods.

- **Minimum network access** - Only add the [`endowment:network-access`](../reference/permissions.md/#endowmentnetwork-access)
  permission if it's absolutely necessary, such as when needing to communicate with a remote API
  that is part of your Snap's functionality.
  This to mitigate users' concern about sharing wallet usage to remote servers.
  If your Snap needs this permission, inform the user before communicating with remote servers and
  include a privacy policy in your Snap that explains how data is shared.

## Transactions

The following are guidelines for handling and signing transactions:

- **Transaction details** - When handling transactions, present the user with a prompt displaying
  all transaction details such as the receiver address, chain ID, network, and amount.
  Show the domain name of the site that originated the transaction request, and the blockchain it
  will be sent to.
  The receiver address is crucial to prevent the user from sending funds to the wrong destination.

- **Transparent signing** - Display the message to be signed by the user in the Snap confirmation flow.
  Do not rely on the requesting site for this, as it can choose not to display it and let the
  Snap silently sign the message.

- **Consentful confirmations** - Before signing a transaction, show the user a confirmation prompt
  with all the transaction details as previously mentioned.

## Authorization

The following are guidelines for user notifications and authorizations:

- **Transparent state changes** - Notify the user about important state changes.
  Provide a prompt where the user can accept or reject the action.

- **Consentful network/account switching** - Ensure the user authorizes switching networks or accounts.

- **Ensure the user is in control** - When modifying or reading internal state, display a
  confirmation dialog to inform the user of the request and allow them to accept or reject the action.

- **Consentful transaction signing** - Before signing a transaction, prompt the user with the
  transaction details and provide an option to accept or reject the signature.
  If your Snap is designed to allow automatic transactions, prompt the user before enabling this and
  make sure they know how it works.
  Also provide a way to disable it.

- **Consentful account management** - When deriving or generating key pairs, accounts, or smart
  contracts, inform the user and ask for their consent.

- **Protect user keys** - Do not allow your Snap to return all user wallet addresses to the
  site, even public keys.
  As per MetaMask behavior, only authorized/connected addresses are exposed to the site.
  Users should choose and authorize the addresses to expose.

- **Limit access to sensitive methods** - When building a Snap with sensitive RPC methods,
  use a dedicated dapp as an "admin interface" to interact with your Snap's sensitive methods.
  There are two ways to do this:
  
  1. Restrict the [`endowment:rpc`](../reference/permissions.md#endowmentrpc) permission to specific
     URLs using the `allowedOrigins` caveat.
  
  2. Filter specific methods to specific URLs using the built-in [URL
     library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL): 

    ```JavaScript
    const referrer = new URL(origin);

    if(referrer.protocol === "https:" && referrer.host.endsWith("metamask.io")) { 
      console.log("URL is valid"); 
    }
    else { 
      console.log("URL is NOT valid"); 
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, the RPC method can be restricted when the origin matches `https://metamask.io`
    or any subdomain.
    This check can be used on any RPC method that should not be callable by all sites.

    :::note
    Avoid using regular expressions or string matching to filter URLs.
    The URL library provides a much more reliable interface for matching URLs.

## Responsible information management

The following are guidelines for handling sensitive data:

- **Logging** - Remove all logs to the JavaScript console that contain sensitive information, such
  as private keys.
  Disable all logging before publishing your Snap.

- **Beware of errors** - Be cautious about potential errors/exceptions that could write sensitive
  information to the console.
  Review parts of your code where errors/exceptions could be raised.
  In these cases, error stacks could be written to the console with sensitive information (e.g., a
  private key).
  This information could then be captured in data logs, or the user could be phished into copying
  that console error to be sent to a malicious actor.

- **Keep private keys private** - Avoid retrieving the user's private key from the Snap unless
  absolutely necessary, such as to sign a transaction.
  If all you need is the user's public key, request it with the method: `snap_getBip32PublicKey`,
  instead of deriving it from the private key.
  Never return the private key in an RPC method to a dapp or another Snap.
  If you want to give users a way to view their private key, you should display it in a dialog
  rather than exposing it to a dapp.

- **Limit exposure** - Avoid accidentally returning sensitive data from a method.
  In some cases, a developer may have a method that is supposed to return sensitive data only in
  specific cases, but due to a typo or bad logic, they end up returning the sensitive data
  incorrectly, causing potential data leaks.
  Even if a Snap has a legitimate reason for allowing a user to export sensitive data such as a
  password or private key, the developer should still take extra measures to prevent that
  information from being revealed carelessly (similar to how MetaMask makes it hard to reveal a
  Secret Recovery Phrase and hard for an observer looking over a userâ€™s shoulder to see it).
  _When in doubt, choose friction over convenience for sensitive data._

## Input validation

The following guidelines are related to validating RPC parameters and handling values:

- **User input validation** - Always validate and sanitize user inputs coming into the Snap-exposed
  RPC methods.
  Be vigilant about validation.
  Never assume that a parameter is safe to use.
  If not, and those values are used inside the logic of your Snap methods, a dapp or a user can
  exploit that logic in an unsafe way.

- **Obtain values from MetaMask** - Always obtain values such as chain ID or address from MetaMask
  instead of the dapp.
  This is because a dapp could display incorrect values, or a malicious one could phish the user by
  showing different values with the intention of tricking them into performing actions they wouldn't
  want to do (for example, signing a transaction for a network they didn't intend to broadcast the
  transaction to).
  Furthermore, if the dapp is providing values that do not match the values from MetaMask, you
  should warn the user in your confirmation flow.

- **Use `copyable` for safe disclosures** - When displaying arbitrary content, use
  [`copyable`](../how-to/use-custom-ui.md/#copyable) instead of `text`.
  A common use case for a Snap dialog is to show a confirmation with some arbitrary content, such as
  for signing a message.
  One common pitfall when using dialogs is that the input may contain special characters that will
  render as Markdown and could mislead the user.
  For example: 

  ![Example not using copyable with Markdown rendering](../assets/copyable-example-1.png)

  The problem is that the special characters `*` and `_` may render Markdown formatting and thus
  what the user sees will not match the content.
  To avoid this, use `copyable` instead:

  ![Example using copyable with clean rendering](../assets/copyable-example-2.png)

  `copyable` does not render Markdown and has the added benefit that the user can click to copy the content.
  Also, the formatting provides a visual delineator to separate arbitrary input or fields from user
  interface text.

- **Transaction data size check** - Always check the size of a transaction data's function arguments.
  The encoded transaction data includes the function signature and its arguments.
  The ABI specification requires that all arguments, regardless of their types, must be 32 bytes in size.
  If an argument does not have 32 bytes in an ABI-encoded transaction data, the calling contract may
  behave differently depending on the contract compiler version.
  For instance, Solidity 0.5.0 treats these non-aligned arguments as invalid and reverts the
  function call.
  However, versions before Solidity 0.5.0 automatically append zeros at the end of the transaction
  data to ensure all arguments are 32-byte sized.
  An attacker could exploit this feature to bypass any security checks implemented in the
  corresponding contract function that reads those function arguments.

## Deprecated methods

Avoid using the following deprecated methods:

- Don't use `wallet_enable` or `wallet_invokeSnap`, which are deprecated in favor of
  [`wallet_requestSnaps`](../reference/rpc-api.md#wallet_requestsnaps).

- Don't use `snap_confirm`, which is deprecated in favor of [`snap_dialog`](../reference/rpc-api.md#snap_dialog).

- Don't use `endowment:long-running`, which is deprecated for MetaMask stable but still allowed in
  MetaMask Flask.

## Coding best practices

The following are coding security tips and warnings:

- **SES compatibility** - Always use packages or libraries that are compatible with SES (hardened JavaScript).
  If not, you may encounter errors that require [patching a specific
  dependency](../how-to/troubleshoot.md/#patch-dependencies) to fix.

- **Timers and side-channel attacks** - Certain JavaScript features such as timers (for example,
  `Date.now`) can expose critical system information, making a user vulnerable to
  [side-channel attacks](https://www.rambus.com/blogs/side-channel-attacks/).
  In the Snaps execution environment, the precision of these timers has been reduced to prevent this.

- **Unsafe cryptographic libraries** - Avoid using unsafe cryptographic libraries.
  `Math.random` is not sufficiently random for generating cryptographic hashes, which can expose a
  user to reverse engineering or brute-forcing keys in the future.
  Usage of `Math.random` is discouraged in Snaps for any critical random number generation.
  Insufficient hashing algorithms such as `md5` or `sha2` should also not be used.
  Use safe hashing algorithms such as `sha256`.
  Also, avoid using custom or unproven cryptography methods or libraries.
  _Developers should never roll their own cryptography_ or use cryptographic methods that are
  insufficiently tested.
  Consider using [`snap_getEntropy`](../reference/rpc-api.md/#snap_getentropy) for entropy and
  consider using the built-in [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
  or [Noble cryptography libraries](https://paulmillr.com/noble/).
  _When in doubt, choose audited, widely used libraries over obscure, untested implementations._

## Dependency management

The following are guidelines for securing your supply chain:

- **Pin npm package dependencies** - Pin all npm package dependencies in the Snap's dependency tree
  to exact versions.
  If not done, a supply chain attack could be used to trick you into including a malicious version
  of that package instead of the original, legitimate one.

- **Secure your stack** - Your Snap's companion dapp and any remote servers are part of your
  security model.
  Consider using [LavaMoat](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat) to secure relevant parts of your
  stack and follow security best practices for your website or server as well. 

## Publishing and Serving

The following are guidelines for making your Snap available to users safely:

- **Snap updates** - When serving a Snap from a particular website, make sure users are getting the
  latest version of your Snap.
  Do not allow any actions on that website before reconnecting it to MetaMask and loading a new or
  updated version of the Snap.
  This will prevent users from using outdated versions of the snap that may have potential bugs and
  security issues.

- **Snap publication** - Ensure correct publication of the Snap.
  You only need to publish the `packages/snap` folder, not, for example, the entire GitHub
  repository for a project.

- **Other wallet extensions** - Be aware that if the user has other wallet extensions installed in
  the browser, a call to the MetaMask provider `window.ethereum` can be overridden by them.
  Instead of relying on `window.ethereum`, use EIP-6963 to access the MetaMask provider in a
  reliable way: [Connecting to Snaps with EIP-6963](https://github.com/MetaMask/snaps/discussions/2001). 

## General rules

In general, when developing new Snaps, you should always put yourself in the userâ€™s shoes and
consider their perspective and how they use MetaMask.
You should always prioritize their privacy and the security of their assets.

- Always inform the user about any action happening in the Snap through the Snap UI, especially for
  more sensitive actions.
  This allows the user to decide whether to proceed with a particular action or not.
  Avoid performing actions in the background, especially when dealing with Snap's state, private
  keys, transaction signing, or a user's Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
  For instance, a Snap RPC method that exports a user's private key without any feedback to the user
  (and a way for them to deny it) is a bad practice.
  A threat actor could exploit this to phish the user into exposing their private key without their knowledge.

- When signing transactions, always warn the user and display all details of the transaction in a
  clear and understandable format.
  This allows the user to decide whether to sign it or not and helps prevent scams related to wallet drainage.

- Always display the "Origin" domain of the dapp that initiated an action in the Snap.
  This clarifies to the user which dapp is requesting a particular action in the Snap.

- Protect user info and privacy by being careful about what you are sending to external servers.
  This includes user IPs, emails, and any PII that can uniquely identify the user.
  Include a privacy policy for maximum transparency.

- Only manipulate a user's private key if strictly necessary, and especially avoid doing so when
  dealing with key pairs already managed by MetaMask itself.

- Always use the minimum necessary permissions.
  This ensures no unforeseen security issues will arise related to "unused" permissions.

- Always keep your Snap source code updated with the latest npm packages and always pin specific
  versions for those packages.
  This prevents possible security bugs that may arise in outdated versions of packages/libraries and
  defends against supply chain attacks.
  _You can quickly check the status of your dependencies by running `npm audit` in your Snap directory._
