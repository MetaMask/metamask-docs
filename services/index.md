# Power your dapp using services

MetaMask, in partnership with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), offers a comprehensive set of
services to facilitate dapp and Snap development.
This includes JSON-RPC APIs for easy access to key networks and REST APIs aimed at automating and
optimizing essential development tasks.
These services streamline development workflows to help developers build robust and successful
dapps and Snaps.

For example, you can use the [Gas API](gas-api/index.md) to gain real-time insights into the gas
market, optimizing your transactions for speed and cost-effectiveness.
