# Power your dapp using services

MetaMask, in partnership with [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), offers a comprehensive set of
services to facilitate dapp and Snap development.
This includes JSON-RPC APIs for easy access to key networks and REST APIs aimed at automating and
optimizing essential development tasks.
These services streamline development workflows to help developers build robust and successful
dapps and Snaps.

## Features

Infura offers a robust set of features designed to enhance the development, deployment, and management of dapps. These features
include:

* **Broad access to major networks** - Infura supports the major networks, allowing you to take advantage of Ethereums's smart
  contracts, IPFS's distributed file system, or high performing layer 2 networks.
* **Failover support for APIs** - Currently available on select networks for customers on Growth or Custom plans; if an Infura API
  endpoint becomes unavailable for any reason, requests can be forwarded to a partner to fulfill the request.
  This ensures that your application remains up and running, providing uninterrupted service to your users.
* **Archive data querying** - [Access historical state data](concepts/archive-data.md) at any given
  block height. This is an invaluable feature for those who need to perform deep analyses of past transactions, contract
  states, or balances. With this feature, developers can build applications that are not only data-rich but also comprehensive.
* **Expansion APIs** -
  [Access Infura's multi-chain Gas API](reference/gas-api/api-reference/index.md). Use the Gas API used by the MetaMask wallet to analyze and
  optimize gas costs on EIP-1559 compatible chains.
