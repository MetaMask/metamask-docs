# Access IPFS content

Access files on the IPFS network with gateways.

[IPFS Gateways](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview) are HTTP-based services that access content residing on the IPFS network. They provide workarounds for applications - such as browsers, curl, and wget - that have no native support for IPFS.

For example, errors may occur when an application that does not support IPFS attempts to access content in the canonical form:

```
 ipfs://<Content-Identifier>/<optional path to resource>
```

A solution is to use a custom-built private gateway or an Infura project-specific dedicated gateway.

:::info

- [Content identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/) must use CIDv1 (not CIDv0) because some browsers
  and user agents force lowercase for the authority part of URLs.
- The Infura IPFS public gateway was deprecated on August 10, 2022.
