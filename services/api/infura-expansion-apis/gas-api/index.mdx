# Gas API

Gain access to the same Gas API used by MetaMask to power the gas fee estimation feature for millions of users.

## What is the Gas API?

The Gas API is a powerful tool designed to provide real-time gas prices for supported networks. It serves as an
oracle, offering up-to-date information on the computational costs associated with executing operations or transactions
on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains.

The Gas API helps users determine the optimal time to execute a transaction based on current gas prices. This is especially
important after the implementation of [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), which introduced more specific
gas price parameters, making the calculation of transaction costs more complex.

## Why use the Gas API?

Use the Gas API to gain real-time insights into the gas market.
The API can help you make informed decisions about when to execute transactions and how much to pay
for transaction fees, optimizing your transactions for speed and cost-effectiveness.
The API allows you to access recommended gas prices based on your transaction's priority
requirements, ensuring that your transactions get included in a block.

Using insights from the Gas API can save you time and money while ensuring that your transactions
are processed quickly and efficiently.
