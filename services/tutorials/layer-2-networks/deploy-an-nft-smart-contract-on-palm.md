# Deploy an NFT smart contract on Palm using Hardhat

:::info

The Palm tutorial, linked below, assumes familiarity and prior usage of the smart contract development tool [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org). If this is your first use of Hardhat, we recommend using the "[Getting Started](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)" tutorial in Hardhat's documentation first before starting on this tutorial.

:::

Check out Palm's tutorial on [deploying an NFT smart contract using Hardhat](https://docs.palm.io/howto/deploy-using-hardhat).

At the conclusion of the tutorial, you will have deployed an ERC-721 token contract to Palm, which can be used to mint NFTs.
