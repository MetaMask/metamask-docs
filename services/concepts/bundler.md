# Bundler methods (ERC-4337)

Infura supports [ERC-4337](https://docs.erc4337.io/) bundler JSON-RPC methods that enable you to build
account abstraction (AA) experiences like gas sponsorship (paymasters), ERC-20 gas payment, session keys, or
batched actions using smart accounts.

If your dapp or wallet uses smart accounts, use the bundler JSON-RPC methods. If you use externally
owned accounts (EOAs) only, use standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods.

:::info
AA moves validation and fee-payment logic into smart contracts. Instead of sending raw transactions
from an EOA, clients submit [user operations (UserOps)](#user-operations) to a bundler. The
bundler collects and simulates these operations, then executes them through a
[shared coordination contract (EntryPoint)](#entrypoint-contract) on the network.

Smart accounts are smart contract-based wallets that serve as the foundation of AA. They embed custom
logic for authentication, authorization, network fee payment, nonce management and execution.

Refer to the [official Pimlico documentation](https://docs.pimlico.io/references/bundler)
for more about the bundler methods and
[EntryPoint errors](https://docs.pimlico.io/references/bundler/entrypoint-errors#entrypoint-errors).

## User operations

A user operation (UserOp) is an is an off-chain request that a bundler later includes onchain by
calling the EntryPoint. UserOps go to a dedicated mempool watched by bundlers instead of being broadcast
as raw L1/L2 transactions.

## EntryPoint contract

The EntryPoint contract is the shared coordination contract defined by ERC-4337. Bundlers call them to
validate and execute user operations (UserOps) from smart accounts. At a high level, an EntryPoint:

- Runs the ERC-4337 validation and execution.
- Enforces nonce and signature checks exposed by each smart account.
- Coordinates fee payment (including paymasters).
- Executes the requested calls onchain.

The bundler supports calling multiple EntryPoint versions (v0.6 and v0.7/v0.8) through the same set
of RPC methods, allowing it to handle both older and modern smart account schemes.

Use the [`eth_supportedEntryPoints`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/eth_supportedentrypoints.mdx)
method to fetch the EntryPoint addresses supported by the bundler.

## Supported methods

The following bundler methods are available on the [supported networks](#supported-networks):

- [`eth_sendUserOperation`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/eth_senduseroperation.mdx):
    Submits a user operation to be included onchain.
- [`eth_estimateUserOperationGas`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/eth_estimateuseroperationgas.mdx):
    Simulates the user operation and estimates the appropriate gas limits.
- [`eth_getUserOperationReceipt`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/eth_getuseroperationreceipt.mdx):
    Fetches the receipt of a user operation.
- [`eth_getUserOperationByHash`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/eth_getuseroperationbyhash.mdx):
    Fetches the user operation by hash.
- [`eth_supportedEntryPoints`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/eth_supportedentrypoints.mdx):
    Fetches the EntryPoint addresses supported by the bundler.
- [`pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/pimlico_getuseroperationgasprice.mdx):
    Returns the gas prices that must be used for the user operation.
- [`pimlico_getUserOperationStatus`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/pimlico_getuseroperationstatus.mdx):
    Returns the user operation status.
- [`pimlico_simulateAssetChanges`](../reference/ethereum/json-rpc-methods/bundler/pimlico_simulateassetchanges.mdx):
    Simulates a user operation to predict the asset changes it will cause.
