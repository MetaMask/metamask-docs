# Get Linea testnet ETH

:::caution Deprecation notice

Linea Goerli is being deprecated. We discourage new development with this testnet and recommend using
Linea Sepolia instead.

:::

We recommend using the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet to store your funds. Use one of the following
faucets to obtain Linea Sepolia ETH:

- [Infura faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea)
- [Covalent faucet](https://www.covalenthq.com/faucet/)

Alternatively, you can obtain [Sepolia ETH](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) and
[bridge your funds](https://bridge.linea.build/) to the Linea Sepolia testnet.
