# Get some testnet ETH

To use the Sepolia testnet, you need some test ETH which is the native token for the network.

Optimism recommends the [Optimism Sepolia faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/sepolia) for this.

:::note
If you already have Sepolia ETH, you can deposit it by sending it to the Optimism Portal on
L1 Sepolia. See [Optimism Docs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/#op-sepolia).
