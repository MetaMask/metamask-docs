# Get PALM tokens

PALM is the native token for the PALM ecosystem and is required to cover transaction costs on the network. Visit
[Get PALM Tokens](https://docs.palm.io/get-started/tokens) page on PALM networks documentation site to learn how to
obtain PALM tokens. When PALM tokens are available in your account, you are able to pay for the deployment of smart
contracts and for the transactions made on the Palm network.
