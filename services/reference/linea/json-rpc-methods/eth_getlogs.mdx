## Constraints

The following constraints apply:

To prevent queries from consuming too many resources, `eth_getLogs` requests are currently limited by three constraints:

- A maximum of 5,000 parameters in a single request
- A maximum of 10,000 results can be returned by a single query
- Query duration must not exceed 10 seconds

If a query returns too many results or exceeds the max query duration, one of the following errors is returned:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32005,
    "message": "query returned more than 10000 results"
  }
}
```

or

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32005,
    "message": "query timeout exceeded"
  }
}
```

If this happens:

- Limit your query to a smaller number of blocks using `fromBlock` and `toBlock`.
- If querying for commonly used `topics`, consider limiting to a single smart contract `address`.
