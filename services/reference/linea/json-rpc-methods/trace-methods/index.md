# Trace methods

Infura provides access to the following trace API methods to allow users to gain insights into the execution of smart contracts and transactions:

- [`trace_block`](trace_block.mdx)
- [`trace_transaction`](trace_transaction.mdx)

:::info

- Trace API is currently an open beta feature, available to paying Infura customers.
- `trace_block` and `trace_transaction` returns [`trace`](#trace) diagnostic information.

:::

## `trace`

Provides an ordered trace of the instructions executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) during the execution of a
smart contract transaction. Excludes precompiled contracts.
