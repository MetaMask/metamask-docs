- `TRANSACTION CALL OBJECT` _\[required]_
  - `from`: _\[optional]_ 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is sent from.
  - `to`: 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
  - `gas`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the gas provided for the transaction execution. `eth_estimateGas` consumes
      zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.
  - `gasPrice`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the gas price used for each paid gas.
  - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: _\[optional]_ Maximum fee, in wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas
  above the base fee.
      See [EIP-1559 transactions](../../../concepts/transaction-types.md#eip-1559-transactions).
  - `maxFeePerGas`: _\[optional]_ Maximum total fee (base fee + priority fee), in wei, the sender is
  willing to pay per gas.
      See [EIP-1559 transactions](../../../concepts/transaction-types.md#eip-1559-transactions).
  - `value`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the value sent with this transaction.
  - `data`: _\[optional]_ Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. See the
      [Ethereum contract ABI specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
  - `blockParameter`: (string) [_required_] A hexadecimal block number, or one of the tags `latest`, 
  `earliest`, `pending` or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
    :::warning
    `safe` isn't supported. Use `finalized` instead.
    Learn more about [Linea's layer 2 finalization](https://docs.linea.build/developers/guides/finalized-block). 
    :::


If no gas limit is specified, geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. 
As a result the returned estimate might not be enough to executed the call/transaction when the amount 
of gas is higher than the pending block gas limit.
