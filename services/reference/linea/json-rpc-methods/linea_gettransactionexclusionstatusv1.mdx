Checks if a transaction was rejected for exceeding data line limits, preventing the prover from generating
a proof to be included in a block.

:::warning

You can only check for rejected transactions within seven days of the transaction attempt. Querying
transactions older than this returns a `null` response.

:::

The API call provides the rejection reason if the transaction fails. 
It returns `null` if the transaction succeeds.

## Parameters

`transaction hash`: _\[Required]_ A string representing the hash (32 bytes) of a transaction.

## Returns

- `txHash`: The hash of the transaction. 
- `from`: The address of the sender. 
- `nonce`: Number of transactions made by the sender. 
- `txRejectionStage`: The point at which the transaction was rejected. One of:
    - `SEQUENCER`: Rejected by the sequencer.
    - `RPC`: Rejected by an RPC node.
    - `P2P`: Rejected by a P2P-connected node. 
- `reasonMessage`: The reason the transaction was rejected. 
- `blockNumber`: The block that the transaction was rejected from, in hexadecimal format.
    Only returned for transactions rejected by the sequencer. 
- `timestamp`: Time of rejection, in ISO 8601 format.

## Example

Replace `<YOUR-API-KEY>` with an API key from your [Infura dashboard](https://infura.io/dashboard).

The API returns a `null` result if the transaction does not exceed line limits or is older than seven days. 
In these cases, the database does not contain the transaction. For example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": null
}
```
