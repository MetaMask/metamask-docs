Iâ€™ve been an active free and open-source enthusiast, contributor, promoter, and user for over a decade. During this time, Iâ€™ve contributed to hundreds of projects and maintained dozens, including being one of the main maintainers of well-known projects such as the @nodejs Docker image and @transmission-remote-gui ðŸš€.

Open source is everywhere nowâ€”it powers most of the internet and countless applications we all rely on daily. The freedom and creativity it brings are truly amazing, and itâ€™s a joy to build on top of high-quality, community-driven work.

As contributors, we dedicate our knowledge, time, and energy to fixing bugs, creating features, and building software that makes the world a little better. But just like everyone else, we also face bills and living costs. Sponsorships are a way to keep the work sustainable, so we can focus on building and maintaining projects without worrying about making ends meet.

Hereâ€™s why your support matters:

It ensures that projects you rely on stay alive, healthy, and regularly maintained.

Itâ€™s a meaningful way to give back to the tools and communities that have supported your own work and growth.

My dream is to become a full-time open-source maintainer, creating new projects and keeping existing ones sustainable and thriving. With sponsorships from kind individuals and companies, this goal can become a reality.

Letâ€™s continue to make the world better together ðŸ¤˜âœ¨

Thank you for your time, your kindness, and your support.
