# Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain network with [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)
smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency.

Use Ethereum to build apps and organizations, hold assets, transact, and communicate without being controlled by a
central authority. Ethereum uses the [Proof of Stake (PoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus mechanism.

Infura provides access to the [Ethereum JSON-RPC API](json-rpc-methods/index.md) method library that interacts with the
Ethereum blockchain. Methods include functionality for reading and writing data to the network, and executing smart contracts.
