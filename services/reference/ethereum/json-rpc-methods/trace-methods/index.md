# Trace methods

Infura provides access to the following trace API methods to allow users to gain insights into the execution of smart contracts and transactions:

- [`trace_block`](trace_block.mdx)
- [`trace_call`](trace_call.mdx)
- [`trace_callMany`](trace_callmany.mdx)
- [`trace_transaction`](trace_transaction.mdx)
- [`trace_filter`](trace_filter.mdx)

:::info

Trace API is currently an open beta feature, available to paying Infura customers.

:::

When tracing transactions, the trace diagnostic options are [`trace`](#trace) and [`stateDiff`](#statediff).

:::info

`trace_block, trace_filter`, and `trace_transaction` returns `trace` information, whereas `trace_call` and `trace_callMany`
allow you to use the `trace` or `stateDiff` diagnostic options when tracing calls or transactions.

## `trace`

Provides an ordered trace of the instructions executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) during the execution of a
smart contract transaction. Excludes precompiled contracts.

## `stateDiff`

Displays state changes in the requested block for each transaction, represented as a map of accounts to an object. Lists
the balance, code, nonce, and storage changes from immediately before the transaction to after the transaction. For the `key:value` pairs:

- `+` indicates the field didnâ€™t exist before and now has the specified value.
- `-` indicates a deleted value.
- `*` has a `from` and a `to` value.

An absent value is distinct from zero when creating accounts or clearing storage. For example, when clearing storage, an absent value means that a particular storage slot has not yet been assigned a value, while a zero value means that the storage slot has been assigned and set to zero.
