# JSON-RPC methods

Here you can find the JSON-RPC API endpoints. You [can call these APIs using a variety of tools](../quickstart.md).

## Error codes

You may encounter various errors when interacting with a network:

- [**JSON-RPC errors**](#json-rpc-errors)
    operations on the blockchain network. It means the server has successfully received the JSON-RPC
    request but encountered an issue processing it. Causes might include invalid parameters, a method not
    found, or execution errors related to the requested operation.

- [**HTTP errors**](#http-errors): These happen at the transport layer during data transmission to the blockchain
    network. They could stem from Infura-related issues like rate limits, API key problems, or
    service availability issues.

- [**Smart contract errors**](#smart-contract-errors): These arise during attempts to execute transactions in the EVM
    involving smart contracts.

### JSON-RPC errors

Error codes returned by Infuraâ€™s RPC service network APIs can vary slightly between implementations, but
they generally follow the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object)
and Ethereum-specific conventions.

Below is a table listing the error codes, their messages, and meanings. The "Standard" category includes
common JSON-RPC errors, while the "Non-standard" category encompasses server errors defined by the
implementation.

| Code   | Message                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Category     |
|--------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| -32700 | Parse error                    | The JSON request is invalid, this can be due to syntax errors.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Standard     |
| -32600 | Invalid request                | The JSON request is possibly malformed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Standard     |
| -32601 | Method not found               | The method does not exist, often due to a typo in the method name or the method not being supported.                                                                                                                                                       | Standard     |
| -32602 | Invalid argument               | Invalid method parameters.

### HTTP errors

Infura-specific error codes or messages could include errors for rate limits, API key issues, or
service availability problems.

| Code | Message               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 504  | Gateway Timeout       | The request ended with a timeout, it can indicate a networking issue or a delayed or missing response from the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |



### Smart contract errors

When interacting with smart contracts, you might also encounter errors related to the execution of
transactions in the EVM:

- **Out of gas**: The transaction does not have enough gas to complete.
- **Revert**: The transaction was reverted by the EVM, often due to a condition in the smart contract code.
- **Bad instruction**: The transaction tried to execute an invalid operation.
- **Bad jump destination**: A jump was made to an invalid location in the smart contract code.

## Value encoding

Specific types of values passed to and returned from Ethereum RPC methods require special encoding:

### Quantity

A `Quantity` (integer, number) must:

- Be hex-encoded.
- Be "0x"-prefixed.
- Be expressed using the fewest possible hex digits per byte.
- Express zero as "0x0".

Examples `Quantity` values:

| Value  | Validity  | Reason                            |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| 0x     | `invalid` | empty not a valid quantity        |
| 0x0    | `valid`   | interpreted as a quantity of zero |
| 0x00   | `invalid` | leading zeroes not allowed        |
| 0x41   | `valid`   | interpreted as a quantity of 65   |
| 0x400  | `valid`   | interpreted as a quantity of 1024 |
| 0x0400 | `invalid` | leading zeroes not allowed        |
| ff     | `invalid` | values must be prefixed           |

### Block identifier

The RPC methods below take a default block identifier as a parameter.

- `eth_getBalance`
- `eth_getStorageAt`
- `eth_getTransactionCount`
- `eth_getCode`
- `eth_call`
- `eth_getProof`

Since there is no way to clearly distinguish between a `Data` parameter and a `Quantity` parameter, [EIP-1898](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1898) provides a format to specify a block either using the block hash or block number. The block identifier is a JSON `object` with the following fields:

| Property           | Type                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[blockNumber]`    | \{[`Quantity`](eth_blocknumber.mdx)\} | The block in the canonical chain with this number                                                                                                                                     |
| OR `[blockHash]`   | \{[`Data`](eth_getblockbyhash.mdx)\}         | The block uniquely identified by this hash. The `blockNumber` and `blockHash` properties are mutually exclusive; exactly one of them must be set.                                     |
| `requireCanonical` | \{`boolean`}\                                              | (optional) Whether or not to throw an error if the block is not in the canonical chain as described below. Only allowed in conjunction with the `blockHash` tag. Defaults to `false`. |

### Data

A `Data` value (for example, byte arrays, account addresses, hashes, and bytecode arrays) must:

- Be hex-encoded.
- Be "0x"-prefixed.
- Be expressed using two hex digits per byte.

Examples `Data` values:

| Value    | Valid     | Reason                                             |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x       | `valid`   | interpreted as empty data                          |
| 0x0      | `invalid` | each byte must be represented using two hex digits |
| 0x00     | `valid`   | interpreted as a single zero byte                  |
| 0x41     | `true`    | interpreted as a data value of 65                  |
| 0x004200 | `true`    | interpreted as a data value of 16896               |
| 0xf0f0f  | `false`   | bytes require two hex digits                       |
| 004200   | `false`   | values must be prefixed                            |
