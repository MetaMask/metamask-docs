import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Simulates transactions across multiple blocks. Allows you to test transactions with custom state and
block parameters without submitting them to the network.

:::info important
This method is only supported on Mainnet and Sepolia.

A maximum of 16 block state calls can be simulated in a single request. This is determined by
assessing the `blockStateCalls` array of objects.
:::

        - `blockOverrides`:  _\[optional]_ Object to override block parameters:
            - `baseFeePerGas`:  (string) Hexadecimal value for the base fee per gas for the block.
            - `blobBaseFee`: (string) Hexadecimal value for the base fee per unit of blob gas.
            - `feeRecipient`: (string) Address of the fee recipient for the block proposal.
            - `gasLimit`: (string) Hexadecimal value that represents the maximum amount of gas that transactions
                 are allowed to consume.
            - `number`: (string) Hexadecimal block number.
            - `prevRandao`: (string) The previous value of randomness, which is
                 used as a source of randomness for various protocol operations.
            - `time`: (string) Hexadecimal value representing the Unix epoch time in seconds.
        - `stateOverrides`: _\[optional]_ Object to override account states:
            - `balance`: (string) Hexadecimal value representing the account balance.
            - `nonce`: (string) Hexadecimal temporary nonce value for the call execution.
            - `code`: (string) Bytecode to inject into the account.
            - `state`: Object of key-value mappings to override all slots in the account storage
                before executing the call.
            - `stateDiff`: Object of key-value mappings to override individual slots in the account
                storage before executing the call.
            - `movePrecompileToAddress`: (string) Moves the precompile to the supplied address.
        - `calls`: _\[required]_ Array of transaction call objects:
            - `from`: _\[optional]_ 20 bytes - The address the transaction is sent from.
            - `to`: _\[optional]_ 20 bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
            - `gas`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the gas provided for the transaction execution.
            - `gasPrice`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the gas price used for each paid gas.
            - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: _\[optional]_ Maximum fee, in wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas above the base fee.
            - `maxFeePerGas`: _\[optional]_ Maximum total fee (base fee + priority fee), in wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas.
            - `value`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the value sent with this transaction.
            - `data`: _\[optional]_ Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. See the
                [Ethereum contract ABI specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
        - `returnFullTransactionObjects`: _\[optional]_ Boolean value which when `true`, returns full transaction
            objects, otherwise, just hashes are returned. The default is `false`.
        - `traceTransfers`:  _\[optional]_ Boolean value which when `true`, adds ETH transfers as ERC20 transfer
            events to the logs, allowing you to trace value transfers. The default is `false`.
        - `validation`: _\[optional]_ Boolean value which when `true`, does all the validation that a
            normal EVM would do, except contract sender and signature checks. When `false`, `eth_simulateV1` behaves like `eth_call`.
            The default is `false`.
    - `blockParameter`: (string) [_optional_] A hexadecimal block number, or one of the tags `latest`, `earliest`, `pending` or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
