# `getTokenAccountsByOwner`

Retrieves all SPL token accounts for the specified token owner.

## Parameters

- `address`: (string) _[required]_ - The `base58` encoded public key of the account owner to query.
- `accountDetails`: (object) _[required]_ - An object containing one the following fields:
    - `mint`: (string) _[optional]_ - The `base58` encoded public key of the mint account.
    - `programId`: (string) _[optional]_ - The `base58` encoded public key of the token program that owns the account.
- `config`: (object) _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  - The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.
        - `processed` - Queries its most recent block. The block may still be skipped by the cluster.
    - `encoding`: (string) _[optional]_ - The encoding format to use. Can be one of `base58`, `base64`, `base64+zstd`,
        or `jsonParsed`
    - `dataSlice`: (object) _[optional]_ - A slice of the account data to return. Only available for `base58`, `base64`,
        or `base64+zstd` encoding. This is an object with two properties:
        - `offset` - The starting byte offset of the slice.
        - `length` - The length of the slice in bytes.
    - `minContextSlot`: _[optional]_ - The minimum slot to use for the query.

## Returns

`result` - An array of objects with the following fields:

- `context` - An object containing the following keys:
    - `slot` - The slot number of the block that was queried.
    - `apiVersion` - The API version used for the query.
- `value` - An object with the following fields:
    - `pubkey` - The `base58` encoded public key of the account.
    - `account` - An object containing the address used to store assets:
        - `data` - An object containing state data associated with the account, either as
            encoded binary data or in JSON format:
            - `program` The program that manages the token.
            - `parsed` - An array of parsed instructions that were executed in the block's transactions:
                - `info` - An array of objects that provide additional details about the transactions in the block:
                    - `tokenAmount` - The balance of the token in the account.
                        - `amount` - The raw total token supply without decimals, a string representation of a u64 integer.
                        - `decimals` - An integer value representing the number of decimal places used by the token.
                        - `uiAmount` - The total token supply using mint-prescribed decimals (DEPRECATED).
                        - `uiAmountString` - The total token supply as a string using mint-prescribed decimals.
                    - `delegate` - The public address of the delegate from which the account tokens are to be retrieved encoded as base-58 string.
                    - `delegateAmount` The configuration object with the following fields:
                        - `amount` - The raw total token supply without decimals, a string representation of a u64 integer.
                        - `decimals` - An integer value representing the number of decimal places used by the token.
                        - `uiAmount` - The total token supply using mint-prescribed decimals (DEPRECATED).
                        - `uiAmountString` - The total token supply as a string using mint-prescribed decimals.
                    - `isNative` - A boolean value indicating whether the token is a native token of the Solana blockchain.
                    - `mint` - Provides information about the creation of new tokens.
                    - `owner` - The base-58 encoded Pubkey of the program this account has been assigned to.

                - `type` - The type of the block. It can be used to differentiate between regular blocks and special blocks such as snapshot or transaction confirmation blocks.
