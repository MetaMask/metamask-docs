# JSON-RPC API

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)
Solana is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](../../solana/index.md#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Solana access is currently limited to paid accounts.
To get expedited access, upgrade to a paid tier. Solana support will be available to all account tiers in the future.
:::

Infura supports the standard Solana API methods and the
[Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API methods](./digital-asset-standard/index.md)
used to query digital assets.
