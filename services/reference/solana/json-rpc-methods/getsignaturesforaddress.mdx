# `getSignaturesForAddress`

Returns signatures for confirmed transactions that include the specified address in the `accountKeys` list. <CreditCost network="solana" method="getSignaturesForAddress" />
Results are returned in reverse chronological order, starting from the provided signature or the most recent confirmed block.

## Parameters

- `address`: (string) _[required]_ - The `base-58` encoded public key of the account to query.

- `config`: (object) _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  - The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.
        - `processed` - Queries its most recent block. The block may still be skipped by the cluster.
    - `minContextSlot`: _[optional]_ - The minimum slot to use for the query.
    - `limit`: (number) _[optional]_ - The maximum number of signatures to return (between `1` and `1000`).
        The default is `1000`.
    - `before`: (string) _[optional]_ - Starts searching backward from the specified transaction signature.
        If not provided, the search begins from the most recent confirmed block.
    - `until`: (string) _[optional]_ - The signature to end the query at (if found before reaching `limit`).

## Returns

`result` - An object with the following fields:

- `blockTime` - The estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch). `null` if not available.
- `confirmationStatus` - The transaction's cluster confirmation status. The status can be `processed`, `confirmed`, or `finalized`.
- `err` - Error code if the transaction failed, or `null` if the transaction succeeds.
- `memo` - The memo associated with the transaction, or `null` if no memo is present.
- `signature` - The `base58` encoded signature of the transaction.
- `slot` - The slot number in which the transaction was confirmed.
