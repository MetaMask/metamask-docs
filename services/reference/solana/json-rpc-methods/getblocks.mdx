# `getBlocks`

Returns a list of confirmed blocks between two given slots. <CreditCost network="solana" method="getBlocks" />

## Parameters

- `startSlot`: (integer) _[required]_ - The starting slot number for the range of blocks to query.
- `endSlot`: (integer) _[optional]_ - The ending slot number for the range of blocks to query.
    Must be no more than 500,000 blocks higher than `startSlot`.
- `config`: (object) _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  - The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.



## Returns

`result`: (integer) - An array of `u64` integers representing the block numbers within the specified range. If `endSlot` is not
provided, the method will return blocks starting from `startSlot` to the most recent block.
