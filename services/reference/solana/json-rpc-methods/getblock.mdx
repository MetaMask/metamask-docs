# `getBlock`

Returns the identity and transaction information about a confirmed block. <CreditCost network="solana" method="getBlock" />

## Parameters

- `slot`: (integer) _[required]_ - The slot number of the block to query.
- `config`: (object) _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `transactionDetails`: (string) _[optional]_ - The level of transaction details to include in the response. Possible values are:
        - `none` - No transaction details.
        - `accounts` -  Transaction details only include signatures and an annotated list of accounts in each transaction.
        - `signatures` - Only the signatures of the transactions.
        - `full` - Full transaction details. This is the default option.
    - `rewards`: (boolean) _[optional]_ - Whether to include rewards information in the response. The default is `false`.
    - `encoding`: (string) _[optional]_ - The encoding format to use for the block data. Can be one
        of `base58`, `base64`, `jsonParsed`, or `json`
    - Returns the block data as a JSON object.
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.
        - `processed` - Queries its most recent block. The block may still be skipped by the cluster.
    - `maxSupportedTransactionVersion`: (integer) _[optional]_ - The maximum supported transaction version to return.
        If the requested block contains a transaction with a higher version, an error will be returned. If this parameter
        is omitted, only legacy transactions will be returned, and a block containing any versioned transaction will prompt an error.

## Returns

`result` - `null` when the block doesn't exist, or an object with the following fields:

- `blockHeight` - The number of blocks before this block.
- `blockTime` - The estimated production time, as Unix timestamp (seconds since the Unix epoch). It's `null` if not available.

- `parentSlot` - The slot index of this block's parent.
- `previousBlockhash` - The block hash of this block's parent encoded as `base58` string; if the parent block
    is not available due to ledger cleanup, the field returns `11111111111111111111111111111111`.
- `transactions` - If full transaction details are requested, returns an array of JSON objects with the following fields:

        - `err` - Error code if the transaction failed, or `null` if the transaction succeeds.
        - `fee` -  The total fees paid by all transactions in the block encoded as `u64` integer.
        - `innerInstructions` - An array of objects representing the inner instructions of all transactions in the
            block (omitted if inner instruction recording is disabled). Each object has the following fields:
            - `logMessages` - An array of strings containing any log messages generated by the block's transactions
                (omitted if inner instruction recording is disabled).

            - `postTokenBalances` - An array of token balances for each token account in the block after the transactions were
                processed (omitted if inner instruction recording is disabled).
            - `preBalances` - An array of lamport balances for each account in the block before the transactions were processed.
            - `preTokenBalances` - An array of token balances for each token account in the block before the transactions were
                processed (omitted if inner instruction recording is disabled).
            - `rewards` - An object containing information about the rewards earned by the block's validators
                (only present if the rewards are requested). It has the following fields:
                - `pubkey` - The public key of the account that received the award encoded as a `base58` string.
                - `lamports` - The number of reward lamports credited or debited by the account.
                - `postBalance` - The account balance in lamports after the reward was applied.
                - `rewardType` - The type of reward. It could be `fee`, `rent`, `voting`, or `staking`.
                - `commission` - The vote account commission when the reward was credited, only present for voting and staking rewards.
            - `status` - The status of the transaction. It returns `Ok` if the transaction was successful, and `Err`
                if the transaction failed.
        - `transaction` - The transaction object. It could be either JSON format or encoded binary data, depending on the encoding parameter.
            - `message` - An array of transactions objects included in the block:
