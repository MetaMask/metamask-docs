- `config`: (object) _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  - The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.
        - `processed` - Queries its most recent block. The block may still be skipped by the cluster.

        or `jsonParsed`
    - `dataSlice`: (object) _[optional]_ - A slice of the account data to return. Only available for `base58`, `base64`,

        - `offset` - The starting byte offset of the slice.
        - `length` - The length of the slice in bytes.
    - `minContextSlot`: _[optional]_ - The minimum slot to use for the query.
