# `getBlockProduction`

Returns recent block production information from the current or previous epoch.

## Parameters

- `config`: _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  - The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.
        - `processed` - Queries its most recent block. The block may still be skipped by the cluster.
    - `range`: (array) _[optional]_ - Slot range to return block production for. If not provided, defaults to current epoch.
        - `firstSlot`: (integer) _[optional]_ - The first slot in the range.
        - `lastSlot`: (integer) _[optional]_ - The last slot in the range.
    - `identity`: (string) _[optional]_ - Only return results for this `base58` encoded validator identity.

## Returns

`result` - An object with the following fields:

- `context` - An object containing the following keys:
    - `slot` - The slot number of the block that was queried.
    - `apiVersion` - The API version used for the query.
- `value` - An object containing block production information:
    - `byIdentity` - A dictionary of validator identities, as `base58` encoded strings. This is a two
        element array containing the number of leader slots and the number of blocks produced.
    - `range` - The block production slot range:
        - `firstSlot` - The first slot of the block production information (inclusive).
        - `lastSlot` - The last slot of the block production information (inclusive).
