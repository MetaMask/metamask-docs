# `getLeaderSchedule`

Returns the leader schedule for an epoch. <CreditCost network="solana" method="getLeaderSchedule" />

## Parameters

- `slot`: (integer) _[optional]_ - The slot number to query. The method returns the leader schedule
    for the epoch that corresponds to the provided slot. If unspecified, returns the leader schedule for
    the current epoch.
- `config`: (object) _[optional]_  - Configuration object with the following options:
    - `commitment`: (string) _[optional]_  - The commitment level to use for the query. The default is `finalized`. Possible values are:
        - `finalized` - Queries the most recent block confirmed by a super majority of the cluster as having
            reached maximum lockout, meaning the cluster has recognized this block as finalized.
        - `confirmed` - Queries the most recent block that has been voted on by a super majority of the cluster.
        - `processed` - Queries its most recent block. The block may still be skipped by the cluster.
    - `identity`: (string) _[optional]_ - Only return results for this `base58` encoded validator identity.

## Returns

`result` - `null` if the requested epoch is not found; otherwise, an object of `base58` encoded validator
identities, and their corresponding leader slot indices as values (indices are relative to the first slot in the requested epoch).
