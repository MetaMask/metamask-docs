# Solana

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Solana is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Solana access is currently limited to paid accounts.
To get expedited access, upgrade to a paid tier. Solana support will be available to all account tiers in the future.

:::

Solana provides a high-performance network that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments, and gaming.
Solana operates as a single global state machine and is open and interoperable.
