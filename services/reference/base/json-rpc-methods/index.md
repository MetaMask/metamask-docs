# JSON-RPC methods

The standard Ethereum methods documented in this section are supported by Infura on the Base network. For custom Base methods, see the official [Optimism Ethereum JSON-RPC API documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/json-rpc) (Bedrock release).

The Base optimistic layer 2 rollup chain is built by Coinbase, in collaboration with Optimism on the MIT-licensed OP Stack ([Bedrock](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started#the-op-stack-today)).
