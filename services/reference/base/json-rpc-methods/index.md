# JSON-RPC methods

The standard Ethereum methods documented in this section are supported by Infura on the Base network. For custom Base methods, please see the official [Optimism Ethereum JSON-RPC API documentation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/json-rpc/) (Bedrock release).

The Base optimistic layer 2 rollup chain is built by Coinbase, in collaboration with Optimism on the MIT-licensed OP Stack ([Bedrock](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/)).
