# Hemi

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Hemi is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

Hemi network brings together the security of Bitcoin and the programmability of Ethereum. Built using Bitcoin as a security layer, Hemi enables developers to build decentralized applications that benefit from Bitcoin's security while leveraging Ethereum's rich ecosystem and tooling.

Smart contracts can directly access Bitcoin state and verify Bitcoin transactions, all while using standard Ethereum development frameworks.
