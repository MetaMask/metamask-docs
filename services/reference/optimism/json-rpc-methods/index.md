# Optimism JSON-RPC API

The standard Ethereum methods documented here are supported by Infura on the Optimism network. For custom Optimism
methods, see [Optimism Ethereum JSON-RPC API documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/json-rpc) (Bedrock release).

You need to be aware of the [differences between the behavior of Ethereum and Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/chain/differences). For example, there are differences related to:

- Opcodes
- Transaction and transaction pools
- Block time and size
