# Optimism

:::note Failover protection

Optimism [failover support](../../concepts/failover-protection.md) is available for customers on the Growth or Custom plans.
Optimism failover support is available on Mainnet only.
Calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

Optimism is an EVM-compatible, layer 2, rollup scaling solution that operates on top of Ethereum. All transactions that
occur on Optimism are posted and validated on Ethereum mainnet using Optimistic Rollups.
