# JSON-RPC methods

The standard Ethereum methods documented in this section are supported by Infura on the Swellchain network. For custom Swellchain methods, see the official [Optimism Ethereum JSON-RPC API documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/json-rpc) (Bedrock release).
