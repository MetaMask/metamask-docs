# Swellchain

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Swellchain is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

Swellchain is a Layer 2 (L2) network built on the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started#the-op-stack-today).
The network extends Ethereum's security using EigenLayer's restaking mechanism, and uses Optimism's reliable
infrastructure for efficient transaction processing and scalability.

- The official
[Optimism Ethereum JSON-RPC API documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/json-rpc)
(Bedrock release) for custom Swellchain methods.
