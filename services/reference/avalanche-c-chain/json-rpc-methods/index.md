title: JSON-RPC methods
---

Avalanche C-Chain uses the Go Ethereum (Geth) API and supports the standard [Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs](../../ethereum/json-rpc-methods/index.md) for the following services:

- `net_*`
- `eth_*`
- `txpool_status`

:::info

Avalanche-specific methods (`avax.*`) that have a dependency on the P-Chain and X-Chain are not supported.

:::

Refer to the [Avalanche documentation](https://docs.avax.network/api-reference/c-chain/api) for more
information about supported methods.
