# Avalanche (C-Chain)

:::note Failover protection

Avalanche (C-Chain) [failover support](../../concepts/failover-protection.md) is available for customers on the Growth or Custom plans.
Avalanche (C-Chain) failover support is available on Mainnet only.
Calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

Avalanche is a Proof of Stake (PoS), layer 1 platform that features 3 built-in blockchains: 
- [Contract Chain (C-Chain)](https://docs.avax.network/learn/primary-network#c-chain)
- [Exchange Chain (X-Chain)](https://docs.avax.network/learn/primary-network#x-chain)
- [Platform Chain (P-Chain)](https://docs.avax.network/learn/primary-network#p-chain)

Infura provides access to the C-Chain only.

The C-Chain supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing Ethereum developers to deploy Solidity 
smart contract dapps onto the C-Chain. Dapps can run on both Avalanche and Ethereum. Avalanche 
Platform's C-Chain is EVM-compatible, but it is not identical.
