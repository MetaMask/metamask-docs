- `balance`: Hexadecimal of the current balance in wei.
- `codeHash`: The 32-byte hash of the code of the account.
- `nonce`: The nonce of the account.
- `storageHash`: 32 bytes. The SHA3 of the StorageRoot. All storage will deliver a Merkle proof starting with this `rootHash`.
- `accountProof`: An array of RLP-serialized MerkleTree-Nodes, starting with the stateRoot-Node, following the path of the SHA3 (address) as key.
- `storageProof`: An array of storage-entries as requested. Each entry is an object with these properties:
  - `key`: The requested storage key.
  - `value`: The storage value.
  - `proof`: An array of RLP-serialized MerkleTree-Nodes, starting with the storageHash-Node, following the path of the SHA3 (key) as path.
