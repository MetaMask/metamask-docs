This section contains the JSON-RPC API endpoints on the left sidebar. You can [call these APIs using a variety of tools](../quickstart).

## Error codes

You may encounter various errors when interacting with a network:

- [**JSON-RPC errors**](#json-rpc-errors):
  These are related to operations on the blockchain network. It means the server has received the JSON-RPC
  request but encountered an issue processing it. Causes might include invalid parameters, a method not
  found, or execution errors related to the requested operation.

- [**HTTP errors**](#http-errors): These happen at the transport layer during data transmission to the blockchain
  network. They could stem from Infura-related issues like rate limits, API key problems, or
  service availability issues.

- [**Smart contract errors**](#smart-contract-errors): These arise during attempts to execute transactions in the EVM
  involving smart contracts.

### JSON-RPC errors

Error codes returned by Infura's RPC service network APIs can vary slightly between implementations, but
they follow the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object)
and Ethereum-specific conventions.

The following table lists the error codes, their messages, and meanings. The "Standard" category includes
common JSON-RPC errors, while the "Non-standard" category encompasses server errors defined by the
implementation.

| Code   | Message                        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Category     |

### Smart contract errors

When interacting with smart contracts, you might also encounter errors related to the execution of
transactions in the EVM:

- **Out of gas**: The transaction doesn't have enough gas to complete.
- **Revert**: The transaction was reverted by the EVM, often due to a condition in the smart contract code.
- **Bad instruction**: The transaction tried to execute an invalid operation.
- **Bad jump destination**: A jump was made to an invalid location in the smart contract code.

## Value encoding

Specific types of values passed to and returned from Ethereum RPC methods require special encoding:

### Quantity

A `Quantity` (integer, number) must:

- Be hex-encoded.
- Be `0x`-prefixed.
- Be expressed using the fewest possible hex digits per byte.
- Express zero as `0x0`.

Examples `Quantity` values:

| Value    | Validity  | Reason                            |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| `0x`     | `invalid` | empty not a valid quantity        |
| `0x0`    | `valid`   | interpreted as a quantity of zero |
| `0x00`   | `invalid` | leading zeroes not allowed        |
| `0x41`   | `valid`   | interpreted as a quantity of 65   |
| `0x400`  | `valid`   | interpreted as a quantity of 1024 |
| `0x0400` | `invalid` | leading zeroes not allowed        |
| `ff`     | `invalid` | values must be prefixed           |

### Block identifier

The RPC methods below take a default block identifier as a parameter.

- `eth_getBalance`
- `eth_getStorageAt`
- `eth_getTransactionCount`
- `eth_getCode`
- `eth_call`
- `eth_getProof`

Since there is no way to clearly distinguish between a `Data` parameter and a `Quantity` parameter, [EIP-1898](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1898) provides a format to specify a block either using the block hash or block number. The block identifier is a JSON `object` with the following fields:

| Property           | Type                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[blockNumber]`    | \{[`Quantity`](eth_blocknumber.mdx)\} | The block in the canonical chain with this number                                                                                                                                     |
| OR `[blockHash]`   | \{[`Data`](eth_getblockbyhash.mdx)\}  | The block uniquely identified by this hash. The `blockNumber` and `blockHash` properties are mutually exclusive; exactly one of them must be set.                                     |
| `requireCanonical` | \{`boolean`}\                         | (optional) Whether or not to throw an error if the block is not in the canonical chain as described below. Only allowed in conjunction with the `blockHash` tag. Defaults to `false`. |


### Data

A `Data` value (for example, byte arrays, account addresses, hashes, and bytecode arrays) must:

- Be hex-encoded.
- Be `0x`-prefixed.
- Be expressed using two hex digits per byte.

Examples `Data` values:

| Value      | Valid     | Reason                                             |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `0x`       | `valid`   | interpreted as empty data                          |
| `0x0`      | `invalid` | each byte must be represented using two hex digits |
| `0x00`     | `valid`   | interpreted as a single zero byte                  |
| `0x41`     | `true`    | interpreted as a data value of 65                  |
| `0x004200` | `true`    | interpreted as a data value of 16896               |
| `0xf0f0f`  | `false`   | bytes require two hex digits                       |
| `004200`   | `false`   | values must be prefixed                            |
