An object containing asset changes that would occur from executing the user operation:

`assetChanges`: (array) - Array of asset change objects, each containing:

- `token`: (object) - Token information (varies by token type). Token metadata fields (`name` and `symbol`)
    are included when available but may be undefined as they are optional in token standards.
- `value`: (object) - Balance change information:
    - `diff`: (string) - The balance difference.
    - `pre`: (string) - Balance before the operation.
    - `post`: (string) - Balance after the operation.
