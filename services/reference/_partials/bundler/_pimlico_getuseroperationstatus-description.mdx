import CreditCost from '@site/src/components/CreditCost/CreditCostPrice.js'

Returns the user operation status and, optionally, the transaction hash that
the bundler is using to bundle the user operation onchain. <CreditCost network="bundler" method="pimlico_getUserOperationStatus" />

:::info
The transaction hash returned when the result is `submitted` can change if the bundler resubmits the
user operation inside a different transaction. For this reason, when showing the pending transaction hash to
the user, it is recommended to keep calling this method in case the transaction hash changes.
