Simulates the user operation and estimates the appropriate gas limits. Returns an error if the operation
is unsuccessful. <CreditCost network="ethereum" method="eth_estimateUserOperationGas" />

:::tip
You can use `stateOverrides` to estimate the gas cost even if the sender has no funds.
However, if the operation is sent onchain when the sender has no balance, it will revert during
the call phase due to lack of funds.
