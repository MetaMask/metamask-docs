Creates an [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) access list that you can include in a [transaction](../../concepts/transaction-types.md).

Use this method to optimize your smart contract interactions. Access lists are a part of Ethereum's EIP-2930, which aims to improve the network's scalability and reduce gas costs by specifying an explicit list of addresses and storage keys that a transaction intends to access.

See the Infura article [Optimizing Ethereum Transactions with eth_createAccessList](https://blog.infura.io/post/optimizing-ethereum-transactions-with-eth_createaccesslist) that describes how `eth_createAccessList` can help optimize gas costs, reduce out-of-gas errors, and verify clients for infrastructure access.
