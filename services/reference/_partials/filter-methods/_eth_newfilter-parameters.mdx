A `filter object` with the fillowing keys and their values:

- `address`: _[optional]_ A contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
- `fromBlock`: _[optional, default is `latest`]_ A hexadecimal block number, or one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
- `toBlock`: _[optional, default is `latest`]_ A hexadecimal block number, or one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized`. See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).
- `topics`: _[optional]_ An array of 32 bytes DATA topics. Topics are order-dependent.

### Specifying topic filters

Topics are order-dependent. A transaction with a log with topics `[A, B]` will be matched by the following topic filters:

- `[]`: Anything.
- `[A]`: `A` in the first position, and anything after.
- `[null, B]`: Anything in first position AND `B` in second position, and anything after.
- `[A, B]`: `A` in the first position AND `B` in second position, and anything after.
- `[[A, B], [A, B]]`: `(A OR B)` in first position AND `(A OR B)` in second position, and anything after.
