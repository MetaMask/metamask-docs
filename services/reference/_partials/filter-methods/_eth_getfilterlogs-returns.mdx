- `log object array`: (array) An array of log objects that match filter. For an array of logs that occurred since the last poll, use [eth_getFilterChanges](../../ethereum/json-rpc-methods/filter-methods/eth_getfilterchanges.mdx). Log objects contain the following keys and their values:
  - `address`: 20 bytes. Address from which this log originated.
  - `blockHash`: 32 bytes. The hash of the block where this log was in. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `blockNumber`: The block number where this log was in. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `data`: DATA. Contains the non-indexed arguments of the log.
  - `logIndex`: A hexadecimal of the log index position in the block. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `removed`: `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if it is a valid log.
  - `topics`: Array of DATA. An array of 0 to 4 32-bytes DATA of indexed log arguments. In Solidity the first `topic` is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except when you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.
  - `transactionHash`: 32 bytes. A hash of the transactions from which this log was created. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `transactionIndex`: A hexadecimal of the transactions index position from which this log was created. `Null` when it is a pending log.
