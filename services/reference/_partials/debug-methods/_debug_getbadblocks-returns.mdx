An array of bad block objects. Each bad block object contains:

- `baseFeePerGas`: The integer representation of the base fee per gas for this block encoded as hexadecimal.
- `difficulty`: The integer representation of the difficulty for this block encoded as hexadecimal.
- `extraData`: The extra data field of this block.
- `gasLimit`: The maximum gas allowed in this block encoded as hexadecimal.
- `gasUsed`: The total used gas by all transactions in this block encoded as hexadecimal.
- `hash`: The hash of the block.
- `logsBloom`: The bloom filter for the logs of the block. Null if pending.
- `miner`: The address of the beneficiary to whom the mining rewards were given.
- `mixHash`: A 256-bit hash encoded as hexadecimal.
- `nonce`: The hash of the generated proof-of-work. `Null if pending.
- `number`: The block number of the requested block encoded as hexadecimal. Null if pending.
- `parentHash`: The hash of the parent block.
- `reason`: The reason why this block was considered "bad".
- `receiptsRoot`: The root of the receipts trie of the block.
- `rlp`: The RLP encoded header.
- `sealFields`: Array of seal fields.
- `sha3Uncles`: The SHA3 of the uncles' data in the block.
- `size`: The size of this block in bytes as an Integer value encoded as hexadecimal.
- `stateRoot`: The root of the final state trie of the block.
- `timestamp`: The Unix timestamp for when the block was collated.
- `totalDifficulty`: The total difficulty of the chain until this block.
- `transactions`: An array of transaction objects with the following fields:
  - `blockHash`: The hash of the block where this log was in. Null when it's a pending log.
  - `blockNumber`: The block number where this log was in. Null when it's a pending log.
  - `from`: The address of the sender.
  - `gas`: The gas provided by the sender, encoded as hexadecimal.
  - `gasPrice`: The gas price provided by the sender in wei, encoded as hexadecimal.
  - `maxFeePerGas`: The maximum fee per gas set in the transaction.
  - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: The maximum priority gas fee set in the transaction.
  - `hash`: The hash of the transaction.
  - `input`: The data sent along with the transaction.
  - `nonce`: The number of transactions made by the sender before this one encoded as hexadecimal.
  - `to`: The address of the receiver. Null when it's a contract creation transaction.
  - `transactionIndex`: The integer of the transaction's index position that the log was created from. Null when it's a pending log.
  - `value`: The value transferred in wei encoded as hexadecimal.
  - `type`: The transaction type.
  - `accessList`: A list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction plans to access.
  - `chainId`: The chain id of the transaction, if any.
  - `v`: The standardized V field of the signature.
