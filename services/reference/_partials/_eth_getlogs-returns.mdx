`log objects`: An array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll. Log objects contain the following keys and their values:
  - `removed`: (boolean) `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if it's a valid log.
  - `logIndex`: Hexadecimal of the log index position in the block. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `transactionIndex`: Hexadecimal of the transactions index position from which the log created. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `transactionHash`: 32 bytes. Hash of the transactions from which this log was created. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `blockHash`: 32 bytes. Hash of the block where this log was in. `Null` when it is a pending log. 
  - `blockNumber`: Block number where this log was in. `Null` when it is a pending log.
  - `address`: 20 bytes. Address from which this log originated.
  - `data`: Contains one or more 32-bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  - `topics`: An array of 0 to 4 indexed log arguments, each 32 bytes. In solidity the first topic is the hash of the signature of the event (e.g. Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)), except when you declared the event with the anonymous specifier.
