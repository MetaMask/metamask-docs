- `TRANSACTION CALL OBJECT` _\[required]_
  - `from`: _\[optional]_ 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is sent from.
  - `to`: 20 Bytes - The address the transaction is directed to.
  - `gas`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the gas provided for the transaction execution. `eth_estimateGas` consumes
      zero gas, but this parameter may be needed by some executions.
  - `gasPrice`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the gas price used for each paid gas.
  - `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: _\[optional]_ Maximum fee, in Wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas above the base fee.
      See [EIP-1559 transactions](../../concepts/transaction-types.md#eip-1559-transactions).
  - `maxFeePerGas`: _\[optional]_ Maximum total fee (base fee + priority fee), in Wei, the sender is willing to pay per gas.
      See [EIP-1559 transactions](../../concepts/transaction-types.md#eip-1559-transactions).
  - `value`: _\[optional]_ Hexadecimal value of the value sent with this transaction.
  - `data`: _\[optional]_ Hash of the method signature and encoded parameters. See the
      [Ethereum contract ABI specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html).
  - `block number`: _[required]_ A string representing a block number, or one of the string tags
    `latest`, `earliest`, `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized`.
    See the [default block parameter](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#default-block).

If no gas limit is specified, geth uses the block gas limit from the pending block as an upper bound. As a result the
returned estimate might not be enough to executed the call/transaction when the amount of gas is higher than the pending
block gas limit.
