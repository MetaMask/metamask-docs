An object containing synchronization status information with the following fields:

- `current_l1`: Current L1 block being processed
- `current_l1_finalized`: Current finalized L1 block
- `head_l1`: Head L1 block
- `safe_l1`: Safe L1 block
- `finalized_l1`: Finalized L1 block
- `unsafe_l2`: Unsafe L2 block
- `safe_l2`: Safe L2 block
- `finalized_l2`: Finalized L2 block
- `pending_safe_l2`: Pending safe L2 block
- `queued_unsafe_l2`: Queued unsafe L2 block
- `engine_sync_target`: Engine synchronization target

Each block object contains:
- `hash`: Block hash
