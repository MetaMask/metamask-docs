- `blockCount`: (integer) Number of blocks in the requested range. Between 1 and 1024 blocks can be requested in a single query. If blocks in the specified block range are not available, then only the fee history for available blocks is returned.
- `newestBlock`: (string) Integer representing the highest number block of the requested range, or one of the string tags `latest`, `earliest`, or `pending`.
- `array` of `integers`: (optional) A monotonically increasing list of percentile values to sample from each block's effective priority fees per gas in ascending order, weighted by gas used.
