A block object, or null when no block was found. The returned block object contains the following keys and their values:

- `difficulty`: A hexadecimal of the difficulty for this block.
- `extraData`: The "extra data" field of this block.
- `gasLimit`: Maximum gas allowed in this block.
- `gasUsed`: Total used gas by all transactions in this block.
- `hash`: 32 bytes. Hash of the block. `Null` when the returned block is the pending block.
- `logsBloom`: 256 bytes. The bloom filter for the logs of the block. `Null` when the returned block is the pending block.
- `miner`: 20 bytes. Address of the beneficiary to whom the mining rewards were given.
- `nonce`: 8 bytes. Hash of the generated proof-of-work. `Null` when the returned block is the pending block.
- `number`: Block number. `Null` when the returned block is the pending block.
- `parentHash`: 32 bytes. Hash of the parent block.
- `receiptsRoot`: 32 bytes. The root of the receipts trie of the block. Also see [Tries in Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/#tries-in-ethereum).
- `sha3Uncles`: 32 bytes. The SHA3 of the uncles data in the block.
- `size`: A hexadecimal of the size of this block in bytes.
- `stateRoot`: 32 bytes. The root of the final state trie of the block.
- `timestamp`: The unix timestamp for when the block was collated.
- `totalDifficulty`: A hexadecimal of the total difficulty of the chain until this block.
- `transactions`: [Array] An array of transaction objects, or 32 bytes transaction hashes depending on the last given parameter.
- `transactionsRoot`: 32 bytes. The root of the transaction trie of the block.
- `uncles`: [Array] An array of uncle hashes.
