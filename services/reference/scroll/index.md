# Scroll

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Scroll is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Infura provides Open Beta access to Scroll. During this period, there might be feature limitations. 
Performance issues are not expected, but they are possible as we optimize and stabilize the service. 

:::

Scroll is a general-purpose zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) rollup that uses the EVM for off-chain computations. 
This allows Scroll to scale the experience of Ethereum, ensuring cheaper and more accessible data while maintaining the robust security
inherent to Ethereum.

Infura provides access to the [Scroll JSON-RPC API](json-rpc-methods/index.md) method library that interacts with the
Scroll blockchain. Methods include functionality for reading and writing data to the network, and executing smart contracts.
