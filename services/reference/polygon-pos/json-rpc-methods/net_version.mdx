:::info For Growth and Custom service plans

This JSON-RPC method allows a request to be forwarded to a partner service provider if Infura should
experience a service issue or outage. See [Failover protection](../../../concepts/failover-protection.md)
and [Enable API request forwarding](../../../how-to/enable-api-forwarding.md)
for complete details.

If you would like failover protection but don't qualify under your current plan, then either
self-upgrade to the Growth plan or contact a sales representative to upgrade to a Custom plan.
