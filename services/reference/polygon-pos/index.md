# Polygon PoS

:::note Failover protection

[Failover protection](../../concepts/failover-protection.md) is available on the Polygon network for customers on the Growth or Custom plans.
Calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

The Polygon PoS network is a hybrid Plasma Proof of Stake side-chain to Ethereum. It's fully compatible with the Ethereum
virtual machine (EVM) which allows developers to leverage Infura, MetaMask, and other tools they use for Ethereum when
developing and deploying smart contracts to the Polygon network.

The Polygon Bor node API is based on geth's JSON-RPC implementation, you can also use WebSockets to call JSON-RPCs
and [create subscriptions](../../how-to/subscribe-to-events.md).

:::info see also

The [official Polygon documentation](https://docs.polygon.technology) for more information about using the Polygon network.
