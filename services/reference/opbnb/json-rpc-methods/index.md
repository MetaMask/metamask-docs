# JSON-RPC methods

The standard Ethereum methods documented here are supported by Infura on the opBNB layer 2 network.

Currently, only near head requests (the last 128 blocks) are supported in the
opBNB service. Archive requests are not supported.

WebSockets are also supported on the opBNB mainnet network and can be used to set up bidirectional stateful [subscriptions](subscription-methods/index.md).
