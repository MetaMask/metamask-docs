# Blast

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Blast is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Infura provides public beta access to Blast, and there may be updates made to performance and
method availability based on user feedback.

:::

Blast is an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that uses an optimistic rollup architecture, providing a
familiar experience for Ethereum users and developers.

Blast aims to provide native yield for ETH and stablecoins. Additionally, Blast shares gas revenue with decentralized
applications (dapps), allowing developers to subsidize gas fees for users or keep the revenue for themselves.
