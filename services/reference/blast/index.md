# Blast

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Blast is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Infura provides Open Beta access to Blast. During this period, there might be feature limitations. Performance issues are not expected, but they are possible as we optimize and stabilize the service.

:::

Blast is an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that uses an optimistic rollup architecture, providing a
familiar experience for Ethereum users and developers.

Blast aims to provide native yield for ETH and stablecoins. Additionally, Blast shares gas revenue with decentralized
applications (dapps), allowing developers to subsidize gas fees for users or keep the revenue for themselves.
