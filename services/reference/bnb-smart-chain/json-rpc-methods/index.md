# JSON-RPC methods

The standard Ethereum methods documented here are supported by Infura on the Binance Smart Chain network.

Currently, only near head requests (the last 128 blocks) are supported in the
Binance Smart Chain service. Archive requests are not currently supported.

- WebSockets are also supported on the Binance Smart Chain network and can be used to set up bidirectional
  stateful [subscriptions](../../ethereum/json-rpc-methods/subscription-methods/index.md).
