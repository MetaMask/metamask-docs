# JSON-RPC methods

The standard Ethereum methods documented here are supported by Infura on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) network.

Currently, only near head requests (the last 128 blocks) are supported in the
BSC service. Archive requests are not currently supported.

WebSockets are also supported on the BSC network and can be used to set up bidirectional stateful [subscriptions](subscription-methods/index.md).
