# BNB Smart Chain

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Infura provides Open Beta access to BSC. During this period, there might be feature limitations. 
Performance issues are not expected, but they are possible as we optimize and stabilize the service.

Currently, only near head requests (the last 128 blocks) are supported in the
BSC service. Archive requests are not currently supported. Be aware of this limitation when making calls
to API calls to methods such as [`eth_getStorageAt`](./json-rpc-methods/eth_getstorageat.mdx),
[`eth_getTransactionReceipt`](./json-rpc-methods/eth_gettransactionreceipt.mdx), and
[`eth_getTransactionByHash`](./json-rpc-methods/eth_gettransactionbyhash.mdx).

:::

BNB Smart Chain is a self-sovereign blockchain with elected validators running a Proof of Staked
Authority (PoSA) consensus protocol. It is EVM-compatible and supports existing Ethereum tooling.
