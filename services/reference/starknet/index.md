# Starknet

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Starknet is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to a [partner infrastructure provider](#partner-and-privacy-policy).

:::

Starknet is a decentralized, permissionless and scalable Layer-2 network protocol developed by StarkWare for the Ethereum
network. It leverages zk-STARKs technology for scalability and privacy, allowing developers to build and deploy smart contracts
that can perform more computations than on Ethereum's base layer, while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.
