# StarkNet

StarkNet is a decentralized, permissionless and scalable Layer-2 network protocol developed by StarkWare for the Ethereum
network. It leverages zk-STARKs technology for scalability and privacy, allowing developers to build and deploy smart contracts
that can perform more computations than on Ethereum's base layer, while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.
