# Mantle

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Mantle is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Infura provides Open Beta access to the Mantle network. During this period, there might be feature limitations. Performance issues are not expected, but they are possible as we optimize and stabilize the service.

:::

Mantle is an Ethereum layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that leverages an optimistic rollup architecture
to offer a seamless experience for both users and developers within the Ethereum ecosystem.
By integrating a modular design, the Mantle network enhances this architecture with innovative data
availability solutions.

This approach not only ensures cheaper and more accessible data but also maintains the robust security
inherent to Ethereum, making it an efficient and secure choice for scaling Ethereum applications.
