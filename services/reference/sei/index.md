# Sei

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Sei is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

Sei is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for trading and exchange-focused applications. It features a
parallelized EVM architecture, native order matching, and subsystems that address latency and scalability
limitations while maintaining Ethereum compatibility.
