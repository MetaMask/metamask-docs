# `sei_getBlockByHash`

Returns block information by hash, including synthetic transactions from Cosmos SDK modules. <CreditCost network="evm" method="sei_getBlockByHash" />

:::info
This method is identical to the [`eth_getBlockByHash`](./eth_getblockbyhash.mdx) method, but it
includes synthetic transactions that are marked with a `synthetic` field set to `true`.
:::

## Parameters

- `hash`: (string) [_Required_] A string representing the hash (32 bytes) of a block.
- `transaction details flag`: (boolean) [_Required_] Whether to include full transaction objects (`true`)
    or only hashes (`false`).

## Returns

Block object including synthetic transactions. The block object follows the standard Ethereum format
with an additional `synthetic` field in the `transaction` object indicating they originated from the
Cosmos SDK modules:

- `difficulty`: A hexadecimal of the difficulty for this block.
- `extraData`: The "extra data" field of this block.
- `gasLimit`: Maximum gas allowed in this block.
- `gasUsed`: Total used gas by all transactions in this block.
- `hash`: 32 bytes. The hash of the block. Null when the returned block is the pending block.
- `logsBloom`: 256 bytes. The bloom filter for the logs of the block. Null when the returned block is the pending block.
- `miner`: 20 bytes. The address of the beneficiary to whom the mining rewards were given.
- `nonce`: 8 bytes. The hash of the generated proof-of-work. Null when the returned block is the pending block.
- `number`: The block number. Null when the returned block is the pending block.
- `parentHash`: 32 bytes. The hash of the parent block.
- `receiptsRoot`: 32 bytes. The root of the receipts trie of the block.
- `sha3Uncles`: 32 bytes. The SHA3 of the uncles data in the block.
- `size`: A hexadecimal of the size of this block in bytes.
- `stateRoot`: 32 bytes. The root of the final state trie of the block.
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp for when the block was collated.
- `totalDifficulty`: A hexadecimal of the total difficulty of the chain until this block.
- `transactions`: [Array] An array of transaction objects, or 32 bytes transaction hashes depending on the last given parameter.
- `transactionsRoot`: 32 bytes. The root of the transaction trie of the block.
- `uncles`: [Array] An Array of uncle hashes.
