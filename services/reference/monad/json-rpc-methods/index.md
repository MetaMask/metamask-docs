# Monad JSON-RPC API

Infura supports the standard EVM-compatible JSON-RPC methods on the Monad testnet.

:::info Testnet only
Monad network support is for the testnet only, as the Monad mainnet has not yet launched.
:::

For differences between Monad and standard Ethereum RPC behavior, refer to the
[official Monad RPC differences](https://docs.monad.xyz/reference/rpc-differences).
