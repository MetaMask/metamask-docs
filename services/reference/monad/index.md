# Monad

:::info Testnet only
Monad network support is for the testnet only, as the Monad mainnet has not yet launched.
:::

Monad is a high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1 blockchain with a throughput of over 10,000
transactions per second.

Monad offers full bytecode compatibility for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so that applications
built for Ethereum can be ported to Monad without code changes, and full Ethereum RPC compatibility, so
that infrastructure like Etherscan or The Graph can be used seamlessly.

:::info See also
The [official Monad documentation](https://docs.monad.xyz/) for more information.
