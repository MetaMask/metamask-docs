# Unichain

:::note Decentralized Infrastructure Network (DIN)

Unichain testnet is supported through the [DIN](https://www.infura.io/solutions/decentralized-infrastructure-service) service,
meaning calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

Infura provides Open Beta access to Unichain testnet. During this period, there might be feature limitations.
Performance issues aren't expected, but they're possible as we optimize and stabilize the service.

:::

Unichain is a layer-2 Optimistic Rollup for Ethereum that's designed to be fast, decentralized, and
optimized for DeFi applications.

This allows Unichain to scale the experience of Ethereum, ensuring cheaper and more accessible data while
maintaining the robust security inherent to Ethereum.

Infura provides access to the [Unichain JSON-RPC API](json-rpc-methods/index.md) method library that
interacts with the Unichain blockchain. Methods include functionality for reading and writing data to the network,
and executing smart contracts.
