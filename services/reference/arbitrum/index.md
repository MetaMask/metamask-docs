# Arbitrum

:::note Failover protection

Arbitrum [failover support](../../concepts/failover-protection.md) is available for customers on the Growth or Custom plans.
Arbitrum failover support is available on Mainnet only.
Calls to the network are routed to [partner infrastructure providers](#partners-and-privacy-policies).

:::

Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that provides high throughput and low-cost smart contract execution. Arbitrum's design
allows it to be fully compatible with Ethereum. Building on Arbitrum is almost identical to
building on Ethereum.

Arbitrum is compatible with Ethereum's JSON-RPC API implementation, which allows using tools such as Infura, Hardhat, and
MetaMask.

## Partners and privacy policies

No personal information is sent as part of partner requests, only information necessary to fulfill your API request. This means that Infura's partner service provider can service your request, but not store the content of your request.

Liquify ([Privacy Policy](https://www.liquify.com/Liquify_RPC_PP.pdf)) is Infura's failover-protection partner and currently offers failover support for all Infura's Arbitrum methods.
